Just got my in laws 15 pluses and they are very very happy. The 15 normal base 128 is the phone I recommend to all my family. I started off with the 15 pro not worth it.

31,How scratchable is the back on the black regular 15,kcucyk5,TwoCables_from_OCN,Theyre all equally scratchable. The black one just lets you see scratches much easier but with lighter colors youre going to see anything thats darker than the color. That can be a good thing though because then youll know when it needs to be cleaned. However the black one lets you know when its dusty. lol Life is full of important decisions. Anyway yeah spend some time at an Apple Store and youll see how poorly some people treat the display models. Im not surprised some of them are scratched up. Think about this too each iPhone is handled by tons of people every day and at minimum some of those people arent careful at all because of the attitude that its not their iPhone so who cares When you get the iPhone I bet youll be far more careful with it than any customer is at an Apple Store since its yours.,2,0,iphone15,18f8dm7,2,5,2023-12-11 01:08:17,Top,7,ambivalent

35,18W Charger for iPhone 15 Plus,kcs3e38,TwoCables_from_OCN,The person at TMobile doesnt have any knowledge which isnt a surprise. So yes its safe. Its electrically the same it just has a different wattage capacity to supply to the iPhone. Also its not a charger. Its a power adapter. More accurately its a power supply. The charger is inside of the iPhone. It has always been this way. The iPhone 15 Pluss charger peaks at 2527W Ive seen people say 25W and Ive seen people say 27W so Im going to say 2527W. So this means your iPhones charger will never get any more than 18W for charging which is just fine. It also means you could use a 30W power adapter or an even bigger one and it would still only go as high as 2527W. Generally never ask mobile service provider employees technical questions like this. Its always best to just do the research on your own and just let them handle questions like details about the mobile plans.,2,0,iphone15,18f6bvt,1,1,2023-12-10 16:21:24,Top,3,ambivalent

Her argument was that I had not really used up all of the memory on my old 32 Gb phone on the other hand having an ancient phone I was very picky about what to put on it.

140,Camera quality,kcn1frr,InevitableNo90,OP I get you I completely agree and understand with what you are talking about. Most people like better photo quality but the problem is as your camera gets better you have to improve your photography skills or you will capture every blemish and issue in a photograph. Unfortunately youre probably gonna have to learn to edit your photos and smooth them out. Broadcasters news casters photographers etc have all encountered the same issue and problem as camera and video technology has improved across the board screens have improved. Now you see blemishes and detail that you didnt want to see and you lose the unintended but beneficial bokeh effect of a poor camera that now can capture an entire image blemishes and background and all. Youre gonna have to do a few things to compensate 1. Theres not really a way to dumb down the camera so to speak. 2. Get a free program like snapseed and edit your photo with the smooth editing option. 3. There are portrait editors that will remove blemishes 4.darken your exposures 5 pay attention too your backgrounds and whats in the background when snapping the photo. Practice and play around with the camera settings. Also dont take pictures of ugly people with blemishes. Photograph gorgeous people only. That helps a lot too Works for me,1,0,iphone15,18e7k8n,0,13,2023-12-09 15:12:54,Top,14,ambivalent

I went for the Plus anyways and absolutely love it. Its light and still easy enough to hold even with small hands and still fits in most pockets that arent tiny. Took me a day or two tops to get used to the bigger size. It feels a bit bigger but not absurdly so. The bigger screen is also awesome for reading and watching videos. The battery can also last me about two days on one charge. Its 100 worth the extra money in my opinion if you can afford it and like the size.,5,0,iphone15,18d6hy8,21,80,2023-12-07 22:14:39,Top,85,satisfied

181,Torn between 15 and 15 plus,kcnfyb1,applesuperfan,So many comments saying get 15 Plus for battery but that seems senseless if thats the ONLY reason imo. As a 15 Pro Max 15 Plus owner I purposefully got the bigger size because it feels more comfortable considering I do a lot on my phone. Thats the reason someone should be buying these phones. If it just feels too damn big for you just get the 15. Theres a reason it exists. Batteries will always degrade but the 15 battery will definitely last a year at which point the battery can be easily replaced for less than 70 by a third party or yourself and as long as they transfer the BMS you wont get that yucky battery message. Apple will replace it for 99.00. Getting a phone you simply dont like to solve a problem that is easily solvable on the phone you do like makes zero sense.

Camera focus sucks last years processor no always on display no new action button no 120 hz pro motion display and worse zoom. I only got the base because the pro was out of stock on back order and I was impatient. But man I wish I had gotten the pro. Like others have said if battery is a concern get either to plus or pro max. If one handed ability and comfort matters get the smaller pro or base 15 but definitely go with the pro in either size if you can afford the extra 170 difference its worth it.,-2,1,iphone15,18cl90i,5,39,2023-12-07 05:51:10,Top,38,disappointed

It just takes 5 minutes to google the difference between the different models of the 15 series and apple has even made a simple ui comparison page on its website for simple minded people folks as well. From this you can deduce if you want those features or not and if you want to pay the price for the same. They have also included battery times too. If you cant do such simple things why do you even exist People stop spoon feeding such idiots. And prevent reddit from being spammed with people who wants everything put into their mouths You can literally walk into any iphone or electronic store and feel the use themselves as well if you wanna a hands on feel about the sizes and if you still can make a choice then i am sorry Edit downvoters explain to me the logic of this post oh wise ones I mean i cant see any meaningful answers from the other comments either which asks fora post like this .

230,Sticky iphone 15 power button,kccgj7l,gre-0021,Take it to an Apple store and just have them clean it its free and theyll make sure its done correctly so as not to damage your device. They have isopropyl wipes theyll soak into the button alone with a horse hair brush that has very thin stuff bristles that can get between the button and the enclosure and basically fix your issue entirely.

231,Sticky iphone 15 power button,kcc7zpd,TwoCables_from_OCN,Give the button a paper towel sponge bath. Im serious fold a paper towel into a small square or rectangle soak it with water and then squeeze out most of it while leaving about 25 of the water behind. With the button facing up start gently squeezing the water in very small amounts pretending you are shrunk down to such a small size that youd be about as tall as the button if you were standing on the iPhone next to the button. Imagine youre down there directing whats happening and that you need just enough water to go in and around the button area but nowhere else if possible. Press the button through the paper towel sponge many many times to help work the goo loose and to wash it away with this paper towel sponge bath. As such press it a few times flip the sponge over press it a few times change how its folded to get a clean spot press it a few times etc. Imagine that when you press the goo gets diluted and cleaned away and it dirties the paper towel. To dry press and hold with a dry paper towel or clean absorbent cloth. Blow into the button hard to get any excess water that might be in there. After blowing you might see a little more water come out so of course just dry it up. If its just a sugary substance this will work beautifully. I am speaking from experience. It wont hurt your iPhone if you do it this way. I came up with the idea when I envisioned simply putting the button under running water but of course I had to figure out how to do it safely. This is how and you dont have to go anywhere to have it done not to mention waiting for a tech to get around to your iPhone.,1,0,iphone15,18cpmp0,2,4,2023-12-07 07:19:20,Top,5,ambivalent

269,iPhone 15 base vs. 15 pro photo resolution and storage data,kc9ma2p,gre-0021,A 12MP 24MP and 48MP photo on the iPhone 15 Pro vs iPhone 15 are going to be the same size. Just like 1GB is still 1GB no matter what device its being stored on. Tbh I would get the iPhone 15 or 15 Plus if I was you. Great battery life incredible camera 6 years of software updates. I sold iPhones for a few years at one point and learned that if someone doesnt know about the advanced camera features of the Pro models they probably dont need them. Id just get a 15 and call it a day still has a 48MP main lens which you can crop into for 2x optical zoom. Still has Action mode Cinematic mode and takes great low light photos.,3,0,iphone15,18cbjfi,5,4,2023-12-06 19:35:35,Top,7,ambivalent
270,iPhone 15 base vs. 15 pro photo resolution and storage data,kcbf93f,flowinginthewin,The regular 15 should be enough. The 2x zoom is fine for 99 of scenarios. However the lack of zoom will affect quality for lets say 5x shots. Pictures will lack details on nonPro. Fast forward 3 years from now when that kid will be in school do you care about not getting better quality shots for lets say sports event plays beach vacation or whatever school events hes in Its marginal scenarios and for 99 of shots the regular should be fine and still okay at 5x but you got to think about it. Plus the Pro gives you extra zoom for video recording 9x VS 6x for the regular with better quality too because of the lenses. If you want to takes lots of photos and video I would definitely go for the 256Gb storage just to be safe and store those videos as well. In term of storage Apple says that a 24MP photo should be on average 3Mb while a 12MP one should be on average 2Mb. So 1Gb can give you 334 24MP photos or 500 12MP photos on average. There is no difference between the Pro and regular 15s in term of space taken by photos. What matters is the details. Taking pictures of trees with lots of leaves takes more storage than a restaurant menu. Higher resolution should not be a factor when printing photos for books since they are small. Its only a factor if you watch them on TV or PC screen. You dont notice it if you scroll to your photo library on phone and I disabled it for that reason. As for the 14 Pro its basically the same as 15 Pro excluding the Max models but its locked at 12 MP. 24MP is not possible. Its a safe option because of the zoom lenses. Again no differences in picture size if comparing both 12MP shots. Its the content that matters. Pictures should be on average 2Mb too.,1,0,iphone15,18cbjfi,5,4,2023-12-07 02:46:07,Top,5,ambivalent

If its made of Polycarbonate PC then it doesnt yellow its a rigid material means it breaks on impact. The yellowing material is called TPU its the opposite of PC it absorbs chocs. Usually manufacturers will make either full TPU clear case or PC back with TPU edges both yellows over time. If you want one that doesnt yellow at all youll want to watch for a PC back with black edges that absorbs choc on the case. Its the only ones that dont yellow and offers somewhat of choc absorption. These ones or the ones from Apple themselves because its full PC. But they would break easily.,3,1,iphone15,18bughw,9,23,2023-12-06 06:46:59,Top,27,ambivalent

339,15 plus or 15 pro max,kc4463a,volleyblock,The price difference is quite drastic between 15 plus and 15 pro max at least 300 bucks. If you dont care about the telephoto lens and 120hz go with 15 plus. Scroll settings on iPhones are very good and even using 60hz feels so much better than on any other non apple phones. 15PM comes with 8GB RAM compared to 6GB on 15plus and hence can do some heavy lifting combined with the 3nm processor although it would be barely any different for the usual daily tasks.,12,1,iphone15,18bghqz,5,21,2023-12-05 17:26:31,Top,34,ambivalent

In your opinion what made you go for it 14pm feels more premium and the 120hz appears to be really smooth i havent used it yet as i have a 60hz iphone x rn but after suffering from severe battery anxiety on my current phone the 15 sounds like a really good deal with its absurd battery life. Since im a power user would 14pm offer me enough or would i miss out on the battery and light weight of the 15 plus idrc about the cameras battery and display matters the most to me.,1,1,iphone15,18a0w9s,96,33,2023-12-05 07:54:42,Top,35,ambivalent

487,Android to IOS a 10 yr android user,kbtif8p,flowinginthewin,You cant put directly files PDF pictures videos word excel MP3 etc. from a PC to iPhone with a cable. You can only takes photos from iPhone to PC with that cable. You can only do it by using internet iCloud Google Drive Drop Box etc andor software like iTunes or third party files managers. If you dont want to use any software or internet you must copy that file into a USB drive then connect that USB drive to the iPhone and then copy it on the device. At least you got a USBC iPhone15 so if you need a USBC male to USBA female dongle its not only for iPhones. You will need to check some tutorials online to learn how to do it.,6,2,iphone15,189ut71,3,3,2023-12-03 15:00:43,Top,11,ambivalent
488,I stood on my iPhone 15. HELP,kbsxa6g,JustLoveChocolate,Oh I had the same today I stepped on my iPhone 11 on the screen while I was on my stairs my housemate put it there because I forgot to bring it with me while I was on my way to my bedroom but made a toilet stop before heading upstairs. So I stood on it with my full weight I just didnt see it in the dark of course. But 12 hours later its still working. It doesnt have a scratch or crack. Screen behaves normally. I was looking into the iPhone 15 for when my phone decides today I díd hurt him while stepping on it And then I saw your post. And I was just glad Im not the only person who stood on their phone today Is your phone showing any damage Because when it isnt showing damage I think you are fine.

Ive tried 4 different Android phones that range from free to 1000 and no issues on either. Then the apple rep tried the same thing on a store model and it also had focus issues.

Ive been very happy with it. Yes the battery life is a bit less. I created a shortcut that puts it into low power mode when I leave the house. This makes it last longer than the PM did.

546,iPhone 15plus or iPhone 15pro,kbrg0rf,Lanky-Refrigerator67,I have the 15 plus and personally prefer this aluminum build over titanium. Not sure what apple was thinking with titanium to be honest. Not a fan of that direction. Aluminum is much better for heat dissipation. Only set back is the 60hz display. However I believe this is software locked because its the exact same display as the prosmax this year. The battery on the 15 plus is the best battery life of any iPhone and I came from a 13 pro max and it totally takes the cake. I didnt want all the pro features this year and settled on the regular plus model because I wanted to save some money and not fork out the price for what I wouldnt use for the pro max. I am no content creator and dont need those transfer speeds of 10gbs. Everythings air drop. I am happy we now have usb c though.

562,Iphone 15 Plus or 14 Pro Max,kbosw81,Holla_99,I have the 15 Plus and its perfect. The extra features the Pro models have I would never really use so while I can afford a Pro I dont really need it. The 60hz feels super smooth to me even smoother than my older 60hz iPhone so not having 120hz doesnt bother me. The camera on the 15 Plus is also amazing. The battery life l can easily last me two days as well which is awesome Ive heard the Pros dont last as long But dont quote me on that. Finally an important thing about the Pros to me is that they are a fair bit heavier than the regular 1515 Plus due to being made of stainless steel and not aluminum. The 15 Pro is a little better due to being titanium instead but that still doesnt make them light. For its size the 15 Plus feels very light to hold and I love it. Basically if you gotta have the Pro features get the 14 Pro Max. If not the 15 Plus is amazing and will do everything you need it to.,10,2,iphone15,1894ldi,6,16,2023-12-02 15:11:47,Top,28,satisfied

590,Phone really hot when it charges,kbo1irr,Elegant-Cover9223,its completely normal for your iPhone to heat up while charging. iOS is tuned in such a way that you get the fastest charging done all the way upto 80 so obviously heat is generated during that period and after that it slows down the charging in order to let the iPhone cool down right before it causes any actual damage to the battery. So I can assure you that really there is no need to worry about your iPhone heating up cuz iOS has its own ways of keeping your iPhone safe while heating up during charging from any severe damage barring normal wear and tear.,1,0,iphone15,188tk8t,6,9,2023-12-02 10:23:59,Top,10,ambivalent
591,My iPhone takes time to turn on when I press the power button,kbnv14o,TwoCables_from_OCN,Its not happening to me but if it were Id try these things 1. Restart so do Slide to power off or just ask Siri to turn off your iPhone 2. Restart this way 1. Press the Volume Up button one time 2. Press the Volume Down button one time 3. Hold the Side Button until the display goes black. Release the Side Button and simply wait for the iPhone to restart. 3. Do an iPhone Restore 1. Do an iCloud Backup 2. Connect the iPhone to a computer PC or Mac. 1. If a PC then use iTunes for Windows or use Apple Devices Preview both available in Microsoft Store. 2. If a Mac then use Finder 3. Click your iPhone in iTunesApple Devices PreviewFinder whichever the case may be 4. For good measure back up your iPhone to the computer 5. After that click iPhone Restore and ignore the message about backing up because you already did. 6. It will download iOS 17.1.2 and set your phone back to the way it was the day you unboxed it but with iOS 17.1.2 7. When you see Quick Start tap Set Up Without Another Device at the bottom 8. It will go through the initial setup steps like basic settings and Face ID Apple Pay etc. and eventually it will give you the chance to restore the iCloud Backup. So of course restore it wait for it to download it and then you will be able to go back to using your iPhone the way it was before you started this. So this just means you start by restarting. Failing that try the different kind of a restart that takes more steps to complete. Failing that do an iPhone Restore. If your iPhone isnt back to normal after this then I wont know what else to try.,1,1,iphone15,188yvrp,2,13,2023-12-02 08:50:50,Top,15,ambivalent

If I have my 15 Plus on a fast charger USBC with Power Delivery the phone will heat up and will get pretty warm. Never enough to be uncomfortable to hold though. Constant overexposure to heat will diminish the lifespan of the battery. This is why I still use the 5W Apple power adapter with a USBA to USBC cable overnight. I only use fast charging when I need some extra juice. If your phone gets uncomfortably hot while charging to the point where you cant hold it thats not normal. Getting warm and feeling some heat is normal though. Just my two cents. Hope this helped.,1,0,iphone15,188eq9s,4,1,2023-12-01 16:27:46,Top,2,ambivalent

642,Upgrading Advice,kbh6z7v,flowinginthewin,There are no differences beside those you listed and size. The other difference is perhaps swapping broken parts which is more expensive on the 15 Pro Max and cases likely more expensive since they are bigger. I think that both models will keep a relatively similar monetary value since they are Pros and will be discontinued in September 2024 like all previous Pro phones. However IF Apple finally put a telephoto lenses on the base iPhone it will likely be a 2x 25x or 3x. Buyers could be tempted to go to that base iPhone instead of a used 15 Pro with a 3x lenses but those who want bigger zoom would likely go to the 5x cheaper used 15 Pro Max. Its only a big big almost impossible IF. I dont think the base iPhone will get telephoto lenses soon.,1,0,iphone15,187tepr,9,21,2023-12-01 00:02:04,Top,22,ambivalent

The Max will retain a higher value because it cost more but they will both be future proofed to the same degree. Honestly it sounds like you really want the Max so you should go for that. I believe you have 2 weeks to return it and switch to the other one if you change your mind.

Last charged it to 100 on Wednesday morning in the UK its 2130 on Thursday now and I still have 32 battery left. From my experience Im 100 converted to the max.

I personally have it on my 15PM. Ive been to more than one store and all iPhone 15 models have it. So annoying It is likely to happen on all devices but most people just wont notice it.

Ive been with my 15plus without a case and use a MagSafe popsocket and glass screen protector. I dropped it once and the screen protector cracked and I replaced it with another. They are flimsy plastic but saved my screen still. Others are right that the phone is very slippery so I ordered some grips that Ill stick to the sides. The reason I went without a case is because the phone was way too big. I came from a Samsung with had a larger screen but its still smaller than iPhone somehow.

745,Apple wont fix my iPhone 15 due to my screen protector,kb1eb21,lloydmar,Id imagine its incompetence from the repair agent. If you removed the screen protector cleaned the screen and sent it in they would have never have known it had a protector was installed. Theres just no evidence that a screen protector would have interfere with the internal heatsink and passive cooling of the device so they couldnt use this as an excuse. If I had to guess someone is getting confused about their rules for a nonauthorised glass screen display replacement and a glass screen protector. Making the mistake that they are the same thing and just following policy. So Id put it down to poor training human error rather than malicious behavior. Whilst this whole scenarios sucks Id take it to another store without the screen protector and try again. Good luck,18,1,iphone15,185efif,27,24,2023-11-27 22:49:55,Top,43,frustrated

The 120hz promotion is enough for many ppl I know to go for pros from their old 60hz iphones. Many people would say that it isnt noticeable but trust me IT IS. It makes the phone feel faster. I tried using my old 11 again and it seemed hella slow. The only side for the 15 plus is the fact that it has the best battery life but obviously it performs less than the 15pm.,1,0,iphone15,185gz9f,1,22,2023-11-28 02:14:55,Top,23,ambivalent

784,Cant decide Phone 15 plus vs 15 pro max,kb1ew6h,Smootie93,Either is a great option. If you want to future proof your device go with the 15 Pro Max. Ushered in the next generation of premiumbuilt iPhones. Getting all the bells and whistles without the heaviness that comes with pro models. Recommend the pro max if you care about having the top of the line. The 15 plus is actually a great phone. Extremely lightweight lighter than the smaller 14 pro while boosting the same screen size and comparable battery duration of the pro max. The new color infused back adds an additional premium feeling to it essentially feeling like a pro model with an aluminum frame. Both come with usbc and new form factors that make the device SOOOOO much more comfortable to hold without a case. The color options will honestly sway you which way to go. The Natural Titanium gives me that grayishtaupe vibe and was a hit with me off rip. The color choices for the 15 plus are actually a hit with me as well. I know ppl criticize the paleness of the color palette but it has enough pop without being overly kiddish. I really like the Blue and Pink colors. The black 15 plus mostly captures my attention.,1,0,iphone15,184zqfr,18,32,2023-11-27 22:53:39,Top,33,satisfied

792,iPhone 15 pictures reduced image quality after taking,kb35xko,TwoCables_from_OCN,Taking good photos of the moon can be difficult and it can require lots of attempts and therefore lots of patience at least until you get the hang of it. The gist of how to get started is zoom in and then tap the moon and then take the photo. Hold the iPhone as steady as you can throughout all of this. By tapping the moon youre telling the camera what to focus on. Yes you still want to reduce the exposure almost all the way down but you have to tell the camera to focus on the moon. So by doing this youre telling the camera app where to prioritize the focus. This is why you have to hold as steady as you can because you have to keep the moon in the same place where you tapped. Again its not easy and it can require several attempts.,1,1,iphone15,1856ccu,5,7,2023-11-28 06:54:24,Top,9,ambivalent

After that you can simulate swiping reach the control center touch the dynamic island volume fold it into tour pocket and make your mind. You can also ask someone to try and feel their similar sized phone like the any post 11 Pro Max but note that the weight is much lighter. Saying that I find it too big is personal to me.

My friend with the 15 Pro Max says his battery is fantastic. I think the larger format phones just have much better battery life. Its not all about the display. My battery just drains and drains overnight even when I activate LPM in Sleep Focus. For the record Im not saying I need to charge it multiple times daily but Im not a super heavy user. If I were I would. I dont know if this is an iOS 17 thing or the fact that I have a smaller phone now. But before I had the 13 Pro Max I had a 13 Pro regular and it seemed fine.

Just little things like that. So then just to see what would happen I did an iCloud Backup then I did an iPhone Restore and then I restored from that iCloud Backup and ever since then it no longer gets warm for things that never made my iPhone 11 warm So yeah Im very happy.

The best thing that I love on iOS is that lets you delete all apps form the device and just install and use only the one you want... For example Google maps Gmail google calendar and etcetera..... From my personal experience Iphone 15 not the pro will do the job pro is only for professional photographers.as I had understand I make a great choice to buy the iPhone 15 Plus and I have not regretted I am impressed from the quality sometimes I use again my previous Pixel divice and I getting shocked how bad was the user experience....

964,Switching from an Android iPhone 14 Pro vs iPhone 15,kam7iyv,Savini72,15 pro max was an android user forever until a few years back. Only reason I switched was for iMessage to send pictures to family and my wife of the kids other than that I would have stayed with android. Another must I had was that it had to be the best iPhone because I wanted to make sure I kept a premium experience with that swap. If you can afford it go 15 pro max or the 14 pro max. The larger phone better cameras and overall experience makes the swap from android to Apple a little easier But Ill will be going back to android once iMessage works on android next year,1,1,iphone15,1831p9g,14,21,2023-11-24 21:41:34,Top,23,ambivalent
965,Switching from an Android iPhone 14 Pro vs iPhone 15,kanutbm,beanfalo,I would get a 15 if the budget allows. Theyre light and nice. Also they have USB C which youre used to with android. The camera honestly doesnt feel too different even with the third lens imo. The 15 is the best value for a fresh new iPhone with so many awesome features. It has more than the others before. It has almost everything the pro has minus the 120 display action button third lens and the same chip as 14 pro. I was going to get it because it is such a good deal but I chose the blue 15 pro 256gb since I got a lot of money for my birthday and am in a spot financially to pay the extra amount. 15 is very future proof with the new port and the chip is going to be incredible for a long time. I hope Dynamic Island stays on phones and more developers use it. It is a very fun feature to use. My suggestion for buying an iPhone is get AppleCare. It is so worth it. I got the theft and loss plan cause I cant afford to replace a 1200 dollar phone lol but the basic Apple care is also great. They will replace your battery for free once it drops below 80 capacity. Also for me 256gb is necessary because I love to use my camera also and take high spec pics. I also download all my music at the highest quality and several YouTube videos for when Im out at college or running errands. Its only an extra 100 and I highly recommend it. Good luck Whatever you get I hope you enjoy it and it lasts you a long time,1,0,iphone15,1831p9g,14,21,2023-11-25 05:25:33,Top,22,satisfied

Similar to you I made switch from android the iPhone 15 plus is my 1st iPhone I gotta say I like it a lot more than I initially thought cuz I realized liked Samsung previously. The camera on the regular 15 is actually really good the usbc made it easier for the switch cuz I used my old android charger before getting a new one for my iPhone. I heard that the only difference for the camera for the base vs pro is the extra zoom so if thats something u want to have Ill say 15 pro over 14 pro. Newest model means longer support usbc is great when coming from android and its honestly a great phone.,1,0,iphone15,1831p9g,14,21,2023-11-25 05:29:10,Top,22,satisfied

984,IPhone 15 Plus or IPhone 14 Plus,kaomedw,SnooSquirrels3861,Made my decision yesterday. Bought the 14 plus. My wife already has the 14 Pro. The deciding factor was the 75 rebate at the Apple Store this weekend. Im with and the Apple Store deal was better. I took AppleCare for 179 a Belkin screen protector and the Apple silicon case. Apple has a machine to apply the screen protector. If it gets damaged Belkin sends a new one and Apple puts it on without charge. No limit on replacements. I have until January 8th to return the phone. My only decision is whether I should keep AppleCare since it s well protected with the silicon case and screen protector. Used my AppleCard for 3 and no interest. I have a spare 13 and if has a great trade in deal within the return time frame Ill trade that one in to with carrier financing and return the 14 plus.,1,0,iphone15,182zg29,7,18,2023-11-25 10:56:03,Top,19,satisfied

1035,deciding to buy an iPhone,kaehm4z,Artistic-Top-5093,Get the mini and the AirPods Pro 2. The mini excels when its not your primary or only device. If you stare at your phone all day714 hours of SoT daily you might appreciate carrying a larger device. That said the mini is an excellent viewing experience for anyone with average or better vision. Another thing is the RAM. 4GBs vs 6GB will be noticeable if you multitask a lot use heavy apps or expect good RAM management to excel for many years on newer versions of iOS. I will say this the question doesnt contain enough detail. Without any detail it most would choose the 15 in a heartbeat. Theres a reason that form factor is dominant. A good way to think about it is the mini targets one handed use the standard 5.8 and 6.1 models target one and a half handed use and the Plus and Max models target two handed use. Theres overlap but each form factor excels in different ways.,2,0,iphone15,1819rrs,8,22,2023-11-23 05:05:49,Top,24,ambivalent

You mentioned you like watching videos on your phone and you plan on vlogging with it. Theres no better generation to get a 6.7 iPhone than this current one. Streaming videos and using the camera will use significant battery and iPhone 15 Plus has the best battery life out of the current lineup. 15 plus does not have an extra gigantic lense that will weigh down the phone and the build of the base models are already very lightweight especially this generation. The edges of the 15s are curved compared to previous generations which makes it significantly easier to hold. Basically going for the bigger size is more of a benefit in your case and gives you almost nothing to worry about. Creds a woman with small hands currently using a 14 Pro Max.

And very often the autonomy lasts for two days. But if I were choosing a phone size now I would buy 14 pro14 15 pro15. You need to decide how you are going to use it and go from there.

1247,iphone 15 plus or pro max,ka3wrmc,mdruckus,I went with the 15 Plus. However if you need zoom keep more apps open play games and like a high refresh rate you will want the 15 Pro Max. It has a better telephoto lens GPU RAM and 120Hz refresh rate. I went with the 15 Plus simply for the reviews of it having better battery life and it hasnt disappointed me. The 15P is an absolute battery beast. For me battery life is most important. It still has a great camera as well. It just depends on what is most important to you.,6,1,iphone15,1806c93,9,17,2023-11-21 03:00:05,Top,24,satisfied
1248,iphone 15 plus or pro max,ka46ph6,TwoCables_from_OCN,The Pro Max would only be worth it if you knew youd definitely benefit from the superior camera system and the Action Button and even the ProMotion display. The titanium frame isnt for improving durability its for making the iPhone lighter than it otherwise would be due to physics and just due to the entire iPhone having less mass overall compared to the previous Pro models. The aspect of physics is just simple since theres less weight around the circumference of the iPhone it feels lighter when you move it especially any onaxis rotations in any direction. Like if you wobble it a lot. Anyway from what you said I think youd be 100 happy with the 15 Plus. Yes being able to zoom in very far with the camera is extremely luxurious but if zooming in like that would only happen at concerts then I wouldnt say its worth the extra cost especially since you said you really dont take photos all that much.,4,0,iphone15,1806c93,9,17,2023-11-21 04:11:44,Top,21,ambivalent

I also like the action button and it has a great battery too. Im not a huge picture person. But its mainly because my 8 plus camera is TERRIBLE and I had no more space on my phone.

Ive switched from S23 so I lost 120 Hz screen as well as the 3x lens but honestly Im very happy with the base model and it doesnt feel like a downgrade at all. I also occasionally snap pictures at concerts and dont do much photography otherwise and I find the base model to be pretty good enough for that. The battery is amazing 48 hours but Im not a heavy phone user and Im just very happy with it plus I love the color.

1264,iphone 15 or the 15 pro,ka2y22p,SochieLife,I can advocate for the 15. I had an 11 pro and upgraded to the 15 plus with 0 regrets.

Great battery life still super snappy yeah your missing 120hz action button and extra camera but IMO it is not a deal breaker for me coming from someone who uses a 165hz monitor. The 15 plus is the best value phone but if you dont care about money or that it isnt an issue go with the Pro Max for battery life alone. The plus and the pro max are battery kings Edit I get between 911 hours of screen on time which is a mix of YouTube FaceTime a couple games Snapchat and more on a single charge.

1325,I know this design is a few years old now but it still looks amazing in my opinion how are you all liking your 15s,k9zklay,Danteangeloo,Ive had mine for almost a week upgrading from my 11 here are some first impressions. I love the dynamic island especially with music if Im in another app it is so easy to control. Battery life is amazing Im 17 so you could only imagine Im on my phone all day. To make the battery health last long. I only charge when Im at 1 and throughout the day I charge to 25 when Im low. But I only really ever charge it at night Size is just the right size I got the base model and I wouldnt want anything bigger because the plus and the max are just too big for my liking. Cinematic mode and just the camera in general is amazing. Me and my friends were pretending to shoot a music video and it looked so real. USB C is great too as the only device left in my ecosystem that was using lighting it is just the best to plug it in whenever and wherever. 5G works miles better than LTE Thats really it I also got it for cheap because of this deal with TMobile and I ended up getting free tech21 case apple watch se for a dollar a month airtags tempered glass and a 20w power brick to go to the collection. So I do not regret this whatsoever. Kudos to the guy at TMobile who took my iPhone 11 for trade in scratched up and chipped,1,0,iphone15,17z3rh6,81,60,2023-11-20 06:17:00,Top,61,satisfied

1459,128gb or 256gb with photos on icloud,k9ymyhk,TwoCables_from_OCN,I think 128 GB would be plenty if you keep using iCloud for Photos. That setting called Optimize iPhone Storage works like magic. So I think the only things that would put you at risk of running out of storage would be if you were to stop using iCloud or if you were to start putting movies and TV shows on your iPhone think of travelling or if you were to start storing far more than just 10 GB of music on your iPhone. So I think it depends on how expensive the 256 GB model is to you.,3,1,iphone15,17z48rr,7,13,2023-11-20 01:13:36,Top,17,satisfied

1489,Iphone 15 or Pixel 7,k9usvef,sirhc9114,Pixel 5 to iPhone 15 here. I loved the pixel line. Had the original pixel 2 and pixel 5. When the 6 came out I was not a fan of the design fingerprint sensor removed and look of the phone. I also have been a bit tired of the android look as well. Sure they can do a lot but just was getting a bit old to me. I was interested in getting an iPhone 15 but came across a promotion that let me trade in my pixel 5 for the full value of an iPhone 15 so I went with that. I had never owned an iPhone before but so far I really enjoy it. There are obviously absolutely idiotic things that iPhone just doesnt let you do like android does but overall I have enjoyed it. You obviously would have to be willing to switch ecosystems but I think thats what Apple really excels at compared to android or google. If not spending anything is more important to you just to get an upgrade Id say get pixel 7 if you are really enjoying the 6. However the 6 to 7 doesnt really seem like much of a jump of improvement. Why not go for the 8 if you really want an upgrade Going to just a 7 for me would be a bit underwhelming. Otherwise I know you could get at least like 300 off an iPhone 15 with trading in your pixel 6 if its in good condition with mobile retailers,4,2,iphone15,17yow73,3,7,2023-11-19 05:08:36,Top,13,ambivalent

Very nice but unfortunately the normal Pixel is not a pro variant and I thought the pro was too big but I miss the normal one all the futures and upcoming pro updates. Then I wanted to get an iPhone 15 pro because we like that size because pixel 8 pro is like a plus. but from some reviews I saw that the regular iPhone 15 is very good costs much less and also has many pro features. the only thing is the telephoto lens but it does this with the 2 cameras so you have a kind of digital extra camera. LiDAR and 120HZ doesnt matter to me. And the titanium will be much stronger but I use a case so that doesnt make much difference. So thats why I ordered the iPhone 15 512 Gb in blue and its great.,4,0,iphone15,17y1vfn,15,15,2023-11-18 19:05:37,Top,19,ambivalent

1585,Iphone 15 plus or 15 pro max,k9ry2o3,flowinginthewin,Not sure. The base 15 is less equipped than the S21. It will be a signifiant downgrade in hardware IMO but an upgrade in software for the ecosystem the rest is subjective. No more dedicated zoom lenses no AOD no 90Hz refresh rate no more software enabled mute mode if you go to the 15 Plus. You get those features with the 15 Pro Max. Now they are not required for your tasks but still they will be gone. The lack of telephoto zoom is probably an issue but probably not for close up pictures like you seem to do. So make your choice. If you loved and used these features they will disappear for quite some time unless you get buyer remorse and switch. Other than that the 15 Plus can be fine. Do not buy an older iPhone model. Dont buy a lightning device if you have a USBC Android.,1,1,iphone15,17x8oaw,3,18,2023-11-18 15:54:29,Top,20,ambivalent

What you need is not a super rugged everything proof case you need a grippy case that makes you be able to hold your phone in a secure way to not drop it. In a construction site if you drop your phone I doubt you will drop it in a flat concrete slab it will fall into irregular groundmaterials which no matter how pronounced the lip of your case it there is a big chance that your screen will get hit anyway hence why the best protection is to be able to not drop it by holding it firmly all the time.,2,0,iphone15,17x2lcw,2,4,2023-11-20 12:38:11,Top,6,ambivalent

And I thats not mean. Its just my guess. The base 15 will offer no significant or noticeable features for you so dont upgrade expecting something new. The S23 is a better choice. All the software will be new but it will need to be configured as well.

1667,12 pro to 15 worth it,k9dbdmd,flowinginthewin,Not much of a difference but some nice features though. The screen is very usable on bright sunny day and battery life is way better. The 2x is somewhat better on the 12 Pro vs 2x digital zoom on the 15. The weight is way better on the 15. The horizontal face unlock is very underrated IMO and a great feature. Dynamic Island is a goodie but not the greatest best thing ever. Satellite and crash detection are not a factor for most people. Of course there is USBC. Its a one and done troublesome situation if you have 5 lightings cable for bed car travel and work but a change is inevitable. Thats about it. The 12 Pro to 15 is an iPhone change that gives USBC a more usable screen on sunlight better battery life better main camera and some small software features but comes with a little downgrade on 2x zoom details IMO. If you want an hardware upgrade get any Pro iPhones. 12 Pro to 13 Pro is a massive upgrade despite the small generation gap.,3,0,iphone15,17vkf64,8,59,2023-11-15 15:48:19,Top,62,ambivalent

When plugging into a car witj usb a to usb c some cars may no recognize the phone. This happens with and without apple carplay. Apple is working on a fix fir cars with Apple car.

I really dont notice the eye destroying difference because at the end of the day Im not scrolling through 10 pages of text. Oh and one funny thing a lot of uninformed thinks is that 120hz makes watching videos betterHuluNetflixYoutube. Well it doesnt because they only support up to 60hz viewing. The app itself while scrolling could be 120hz but the video itself only goes up to 60.,3,0,iphone15,17v6pha,20,53,2023-11-15 02:01:14,Top,56,ambivalent

The camera is pretty good dynamic island maximum brightnessdisplay felt like a big improvement over the regular 14. I really dont have any complaints about the 15. Sure the regular one is lacking AOD and 120hz but since I wasnt used to these features I dont miss those features. The regular line is enough for most people.

1833,What improvements can they make now,k93jo9x,TwoCables_from_OCN,Maybe they will find a way to have everything for the selfie camera and Face ID be under the display so that theres nothing but display. Not even a tiny little hole. What I mean by find a way is finding a way that satisfies their high standards. Maybe they will also find some way to no longer need any kind of a port like what we have now with the USBC port. Perhaps something is coming we cant even imagine right now something wireless like Bluetooth but better. Id like true wireless contactless charging somehow. Just have some sort of a Teslalike transmitter that can charge the iPhone. Maybe camera technology will advance so much at some point that the iPhone camera system can include a mirrorless camera. Maybe too the camera sensor technology will advance so far that the base models will make todays Pro models very inferior in comparison. I think it would be fun to have a thermometer on my iPhone. Of course it would have to be some new advanced thermometer technology that would enable the user to take their iPhone out of their warm pants pocket and get an accurate air temperature reading of the air temperature outside of the pocket without having to wait for the thermometer to be cooled down or warmed up first whatever the case might be. This imaginary hightech thermometer would also be able to tell you the temperature of water by just putting the phone under water. Im sure by then iPhones will be able to be truly waterproof instead of just being water resistant. I think it would be cool to have true Night Vision from the camera. I know what youre thinking today we can just use the flashlight. Hear me out though a flashlight doesnt illuminate everything equally. It has a limited range. With true Night Vision you could see everything in the dark equally just like with Night Vision goggles. So then all youd have to do is turn it on and look at everything around you right on the display. Another scenario where Id make use of Night Vision is if I need to see in the dark but I dont want to turn the flashlight on because even at its lowest brightness it can be too bright where turning it off means I cant see as well as I could in the dark before turning it on. Every once in a while when Im ready to go to sleep and I have just one light on set to 1 brightness to the color red but I need more light for a sec I kinda hate using the flashlight even at its lowest brightness because it can be too bright. Id love to have Night Vision so that I can just turn that on and see what I need to see without being blinded like I can be for a moment after turning the flashlight off. Plus its a very alerting light. So another thing Id love to have is the ability to change the color of the flashlight. So in the above scenario without Night Vision Id just turn on a red flashlight instead of this bright daylight blue one. So Im imagining longpressing the flashlight in Control Center and getting options for color in addition to brightness. That way Id choose the color and probably a low brightness and then Id turn it on. Oh hey Night Vision photos and videos. I think Im done spitballing my ideas.,1,0,iphone15,17u9cw7,4,20,2023-11-13 18:15:07,Top,21,frustrated

1840,Is there still a lead time for new iPhones,k93d2u0,TwoCables_from_OCN,Trading in is easier when you have the iPhone shipped to you because then you can set up the new iPhone in the relaxed environment of your own home and you have all the time you could ever want to make sure its ok to let go of the old iPhone. Meaning you have all the time you could ever want to know that its safe to put the old iPhone into the tradein state meaning its completely restored back to the condition it was in the first time it was turned on. I got my iPhone 15 Pro from Xfinity Mobile. The day it was delivered I turned it on and set it up and moved in. Xfinity Mobile needed to be in possession of my old iPhone within 14 days to complete the tradein. Thats far better than trying to do it all in one visit to a store. See this way if something doesnt go right I still have plenty of time to start over and try again because Im just chillin at home with both iPhones the new one and the old one.,1,1,iphone15,17uaray,2,16,2023-11-13 17:36:28,Top,18,ambivalent

1990,are the apple cases good,k8w2hdw,Edge_Audio,This is a very personal and often heated conversation. Apple cases are overpriced as with everything Apple. Now thats out of the way. Due to a big mix up Apple offered me some goodwill and I have a Finewoven in green and silicone in blue for my 15 Pro Max. I like both of them After three weeks of pretty normal use not pampering the Finewoven still looks new. I use a magsafe charger every night and in the car. Its made a slight mark but also on the leather. I like the feel fit and finish. The silicone case Ive used for about a week. It has a nice soft feel thats still slick enough to get in and out of a pocket.

1993,are the apple cases good,k8w3ena,Saigonic,Good but not great. Some not all users usually sport them so they can show off the apple logo. Generally you can get better bang for your buck elsewhere but people pay that sweet apple premium. For me silicone is okay. Not that durable pulls out all of my pockets but is very soft. FineWoven has a great fit but its durability and ease of cleaning for me wasnt that great.

1994,are the apple cases good,k8wevxx,AssistantPotential78,For the 15 series No. The silicone cases like all silicone cases they are a lint magnet and sticks to your pockets. Have never recommended any silicone cases. The finewoven cases these are the least bang for the buck accessory apple possibly have ever created. Absolute trash. Terrible. Clear case could be good I dont have an opinion since I havent used them. Ive heard since the apple ones are hard back cases they dont stretch and hence have lower shock obsorbsion. And also they seem to lack cover protection at teh bottom Go with a leather case by andar nomad etc if you can afford it.

1996,are the apple cases good,k8wl3nw,hocotate,Ive owned the silicone cases in the past and I always find them too slippery for me. I got the clear cases for my 12 Pro on eBay with refurbishedreturned quality so I could get them for basically 13rd of the price lol and LOVE the clear cases. They use hard plastic instead of TPU so the cases dont yellow as much over time. I agree with others in that its a little tighttoo hard in that itll crack in the bottom corners bc its hard plastic but I paid a fraction of the price of a new clear case that I was fine with the cracks since replacing them was so cheap for me. Im testing out other cases for my 15 Pro but I might go back to Apples clear case bc I really liked them and theyre worth paying the full price to me at least since it was basically the only case I used for my last phone,1,0,iphone15,17tcgjf,6,18,2023-11-12 08:14:41,Top,19,ambivalent

The XR was a good phone for its time but definitely feels aged now. I really like the bigger brighter screen way better cameras and battery that lasts for more than a day and much more storage for a marginal increase in weight. A lot of people hate on how washed out the colours are this year especially the blue one but Ive grown to like it. Sure I wish it was more blue like the XR but I also like how new and different the pale colour looks.

I love the finish I was this close to buying a non pro blue or green but I cant go back to 60hz. I use her phone all the time and I can very much so notice it. iOS is smooth but a lot less so with 60hz. Its choppy pretty bad its fine if youre not a tech person I guess but if youre asking about it then you know about it and it will suck. I think the regular 15 lineup is beautiful and I think they did great with the pastel collection. In hindsight I made the right decision I love the Pro. I love the Natural titanium color and been having fun with the camera. I like knowing have the latest and greatest chip and I got 1TB this time which is a great feeling Apple really needs to add ProMotion across the whole line.

You can only compare if you use them both and the same time and compare the 2 images. Its also possible the iPhone XR had a worse screen so you werent able to see all the details the iPhone 15 does. Some people think their iPhone takes better pictures than a mirrorless camera would because they look at the camera LCD. It isnt until they load both pictures on a computer where they realize the big camera was actually more superior.,0,0,iphone15,17smfn7,0,10,2023-11-11 04:40:32,Top,10,ambivalent

It just makes the pictures so dull and ded while increasing skin texture for some reason. Its something that apple needs to fix The only way to get better selfies are by 1. Take a burst shot you can slide to a different frame and itll actually look better and more realistic 2. Take a live photo and choose a different frame as mentioned above 3. Record a video and take a screenshot 4. Just take a screenshot of the screen in the front camera mode P.s its not your face or the dirty screenguardcamera or the iphone screen.,0,0,iphone15,17smfn7,0,10,2023-11-11 07:38:40,Top,10,frustrated
2137,15 Pro Camera Sucks,k8ressx,jayken424,So a few things 1Snapchat is heavily filtered. You look more like what your pro camera shows. Its more sharp hence the grainy look on a small screen. 2let your image process a little then go back to it after a few minutes. I found that it takes a while to get the actual coloring to set. Really weird. Almost like youre waiting for your photos to develop. 3. youll want to edit your photos. What I usually do is turn down contrast a tad up the warmness to your liking and if you want your pores to slightly disappear turn up noise reduction. I had the X and it basically smoothened out my face. It was lower quality and has a more filtered look. Hence the jarring contrast to your new high quality camera. lol.

The things I disliked about the 12 mini were the screen dim outdoors and the battery. The 15 solves both of those while also upgrading the processor and giving me a better camera.

2224,2080 Rule for Charging iPhone 15 Pro and AppleWatch Ultra 2,k8j5jsb,TwoCables_from_OCN,I think its stupid. The battery is there for you to enjoy your iPhone. Its a consumablereplaceable part. Why reduce the quality of your iPhone experience by effectively shrinking the size of your battery due to never charging past 80 and never letting it drop below 20 So that it might last a few weeks longer before you have to replace it smh Also if you never deviate from 2080 you battery level readings and Maximum Capacity estimate will get less and less and less accurate. This is why using the 80 Limit setting still allows the battery to be charged to 100 on occasion and this is why its good to recalibrate the battery 23 times per year by doing at least one cycle of 0 to 100. People worry too much about their battery. I think its like worrying about the tires on your car so much that you compromise the way you drive just so your tires last a little longer.,5,0,iphone15,17rcovd,8,21,2023-11-09 18:05:01,Top,26,frustrated

The battery does get worse with time battery health is a thing but is not as drastic as people make it look by the time you feel that your battery is not lasting long enough there is a huge chance that your battery drain is happening because you have so many apps with permissions like background app refresh push notifications location services tracking etc and not because your battery has lost most of its juice due to battery degradation you will probably switch to a new phone before the battery health gets under 80 making the cap useless. Im using the 80 cap myself only because I have a charger at home at my car at the office and I never run out of juice during the day with 80 battery otherwise I would not be capping it if I really needed that 20 so dont stressing yourself if you need the 100 battery then use it it wont degrade fast enough that you would regret it in the long run.,1,0,iphone15,17rcovd,8,21,2023-11-20 13:01:20,Top,22,ambivalent

2273,Iphone 15 128gb vs 256gb,k8j45t6,flowinginthewin,256Gb. High quality photos probably means 48MP pictures that can take up to 5Mb low details to lets say 18Mb high details like trees at fall season. It will fill up fast not mentioning 4K videos. I assume you will never compress them or delete them and your current storage is somewhat full. So take the 256Gb. I never delete pictures and I always compress them thus my storage filling rate is not high so 128gb is enough for me. Resale value is higher than the 128Gb and can be sold to someone who reached the limit of their 128Gb phone and refuse to delete pictures compress photos or use iCloud. Not sure though about selling a used iPhone 15 in 5 years. Ita like buying an iPhone Xr today. It will not be a good buy.,2,1,iphone15,17qtass,6,19,2023-11-09 17:56:48,Top,22,ambivalent

Things like customisation and freedom to modify your phone will be limited through. I suggest you invest in a good case for your phone to protect it from drops you can use nonapple accessories like Belkin and Anker.

I HATE the fact that I cannot find a reputable case maker Otterbox that makes a case with a sliding window for the camera. Or a door that closes anything. Thats all I want. Amazon has a few but the reviews are all over the place. The sticky camera protectors on the market suck and leave residue.

2382,256 gb or 512 gb,k86j33m,TwoCables_from_OCN,It depends on lots of factors. I have the 128 GB iPhone 15 Pro and I have 200 GB of iCloud storage. I also keep the setting enabled called Optimize iPhone Storage which for me means about 99.99 of the data my photos and videos consumes is in iCloud. This changes a little bit if I look at some of my photos and videos because they download but a little while later they get reset back to being the smaller versions while the fullsized versions remain in iCloud. I love it I dont have much else on my iPhone at all though so this is great. I only have about 2425 GB of stuff on my iPhone. This isnt ideal for everyone of course Like say if I were someone who wanted to have lots of movies and shows right on my iPhone and maybe also a massive collection of music and maybe also tons of video games. If that were me then 128 GB would definitely not be enough for me.

Sure you can pick out features like the dynamic island the better cameras that justify upgrading but the question is do you care about those things Is it worth it to you As far as fragility or issues with the phone itself goes Ive heard a lot about it but never actually seen 1 manufacturer issue with a 15.

I bet if they do another review the results might be different. Also mrwhostheboss battery test was flawed. He did inserted a SIM card in the 15PM for the first few hours of his test which resulted in a lower battery result than the 15. Unfortunately this was being quoted by many sites saying that the 15 battery is better. GSMArena and notebookcheck results shown otherwise. My personal experience is also consistent that the 15PM has a better battery life than the 15.,0,0,iphone15,17na5cp,6,39,2023-11-04 03:45:21,Top,39,ambivalent
2592,is the Red Pocket deal better compared to ATT and Verizon,k81j1ac,i_speak_the_truf,Red Pocket is going to be a better deal simply because their service is much cheaper. Their plans start at 10 a month including 40 for unlimited data I think on ATTs network. The ATT and Verizon deals lock you in to a device payment plan and thus 90 service for three years. The best deal from the major carriers right now is probably TMobile who tends to have slightly cheaper plans and has you pay off the phone with tradein credits over two years. Depending on your current carrier you can get really aggressive with TMobile promotions for me switching from Xfinity they paid off my 14 Pro balance 400 offered me 200 credit per line to switch and gave me 830 in credits over two years with a tradein. Also the tradein doesnt have to be unlocked so you can buy an iPhone SE from WalMart for 150 and trade it in then sell your ideally more valuable existing iPhone on eBay. Some of the folks on rtmobile had also reported buying a Galaxy S9 for 70 on eBay and trading that in for the 830 promotion. Red Pockets deal is also better because they give you the full rebate after three months of service. This is what Xfinity used to do and it was a great deal because you could get a new phone every year for basically free. The 300 is close to how much an iPhone depreciates over a year so you can pay off your phone at any time get it unlocked then sell it on eBaySwappa when the new phone comes out. I did this on Xfinity for three years going from an iPhone 12 Mini to a 13 Pro to a 14 Pro paying nothing out of pocket except with the 14 Pro they finally forced the rebates over a payment plan like the other carriers do.,2,0,iphone15,17nekq2,2,1,2023-11-06 07:22:39,Top,3,ambivalent

Colour is a personal choice and its subjective but you cant go wrong with either colour as both look really good. In my opinion the Blue will age better with time. The Green just didnt feel as wow and exciting to me as the Blue. Ill say visit a store and see for yourself. Just close your eyes and visualise yourself taking it out of pocket.

2652,Iphone 15 or go pro,k7q9bhc,John_Likes_Computers,The 15 is the best option for most people plus once you get used to the promotion gimmick on a phone thats when apple locks you in. In my opinion spend the extra money on a MacBook pro and iPad with promotion more bang for your buck Plus heres the thing with the cameras. the 15 can do about 78th the things the pros can do in regard to photography and video things. If you literally make a living recording hours upon hours of 4K pro res video every week then get the pro otherwise get the 15. Also everthing is mute if your well off. For example if you make 6 figures it probably doesnt matter too much what you get especially since youre keeping it for a while.

2655,Iphone 15 or go pro,k7oqkel,Comfortable-Basil-47,I upgraded from the iPhone 11 to the 15 pro. Ill be honest it was a more of a pity upgrade. I really think next year will have the big changes such as the iPhone 16 ultra and the smaller pro getting the same zoom lens as the 15PM but I really needed to tradein my iPhone 11 so my tradein value with my carrier didnt tank. After watching all the reviews on Youtube I concluded that the 15 pro was the worst of the entire lineup because of the worst battery. Why did I get it I just really wanted the 8gb of ram and the smaller form factor. I didnt care about the 120Hz or the action button. But now having it in my hand wow. I never knew AOD would be helpful as much as I thought. I dont use it the entire night hooked to a stand or anything but use it for only a couple minutes such as in the morning before heading to class or when I dont have time to actually pickup my phone to check the timeI assume this wouldnt be a problem if you have an apple watch The action button was a neat addition and I find it way more useful than the silent switch. You can map multiple actions to the button with some shortcut tricks so I can toggle AOD set Airdrop to everyone for 10 min shazam a song and still keep it as a silent switch. Battery life has actually surprised me. Its about the same battery life on 5G and might be slightly better than my iPhone 11 with 4GLTE. It does get warmer than I would like but Im hoping it gets better with better optimization for the apps I use in the future. TLDR Get the 15 pro. Theres a lot of nice QOL changes that make a big difference. If you can hold it for another year and dont care about tradeins like I do get the iPhone 15 now or 1616 pro next year. My iPhone 11 was a champ but yeah 64gb was not cutting it.,1,0,iphone15,17msvzg,19,35,2023-11-03 18:44:48,Top,36,ambivalent
2656,Iphone 15 or go pro,k7otfbr,thesecondbread,I got the regular 15 upgraded from the XR. I didnt buy a pro because I would have had to wait a month for it to come and my XR completely stopped charging. The regular 15 is a good phone the camera is great and the battery is decent. If you havent had a phone with 120hz 60hz is definitely still fine. The pro is definitely worth the extra 200 but if yoi get the regular ure not missing on a lot.,1,0,iphone15,17msvzg,19,35,2023-11-03 19:02:18,Top,36,ambivalent

Other than that the 128Gb can be okay if you delete some pictures turn them to HEIC if they are in JPEG and compress some of them but its likely too much hassle for most people.,1,0,iphone15,17ly977,3,22,2023-11-02 23:03:18,Top,23,ambivalent

2747,Is it better for me to choose 15 Plus or Pro,k7ctzx0,xroalx,Coming from S23 Ive had a similar dilemma except it was 15 vs 15 Pro for me. The PlusMax is too big for my liking. After a long time of debating and thinking the Pro does not really offer that much for the added price tag and comes with a slightly worse battery than the base 15. The 120 Hz display well Ive had that on the S23 but dont miss it at all on my base 15. Always on havent used it on my S23 either faster data transfers over USB are also not worth it as Im using CloudAirDrop anyway not cables. Theres the 3x camera which the S23 has as well but I used it so rarely and my pictures consist of shooting something when traveling and never looking back at it its not worth it. The only other thing is the action button which I imagine Id play around with for a while and then set some mundane thing to it anyways and almost forget its a thing. Those things alone arent worth the extra price weight and slightly worse battery. I second what others said go with the Plus unless you want to do professional photography with your phone.

No real difference other than battery life and USBC. The notch features are kinda cool and Siri seems better. Im yet to really try the camera but 0.5 lens is cool to have. But the XS has iso17 so youll see no obvious improvements during normal use. Disappointed that the screen refresh rate is the same.

Unless you change the way you use your phone you wont feel a difference other than the slightly better camera and battery. If you want something interesting that changes how you use a smartphone get a Foldable phone. The problem with many of them are that they are expensivemuch more than the iPhone and usually come with drawbacks such as unremovable screen protectors and weak durability. Also I noticed something. When you search iPhone X into google The first result from Apple.com says Sep 12 2017 Apple announces iPhone X the future of the smartphone... When you do the same with the iPhone 15 you get iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. Dynamic Island. 48MP Main camera with 2x Telephoto. Allday battery life. USBC. 6.1 and 6.7 sizes. And for the pro you get Gigablast your gigabits. ... iPhone 15 Pro is the first iPhone to support USB 3 for a huge leap in data transfer speeds and faster pro workflows than ever before ... Notice how they say future of the smartphone for the iPhone X and just talk about specs of the iPhone for the others. Theyve essentially built the iPhone 15 and the 1114 based on the X. I believe a similar moment will happen with the iPhone XX when that gets released.,1,1,iphone15,17kpmhk,277,255,2023-11-01 04:41:08,Top,257,ambivalent

Then with Optimize iPhone Storage enabled getting back on my WiFi here at home freed up almost 100 of that.

Videos are not affected. The ratio is 15 more storage space. A 12 MP takes around 2MB and a 24MP takes around 3MB according to iOS if its in HEIC. I would say to go to 256Gb if you use iCloud for all and forever but if you ran out of storage with 256Gb while recording AND plan on doing the same sooner or later without reducing resolution and FPS then get the 512Gb.,1,0,iphone15,17jq4fb,17,16,2023-10-30 14:30:51,Top,17,ambivalent

3070,15 pro max mute switch,k7177ha,flowinginthewin,Dont have the action button but I hate it with a passion because of its binary mode. Its either all vibrations or all sound. No room for lets say put some app on vibrationsonly even if its not on mute and when its not on mute you cant set up custom notification sound for apps so a weather notification random text message and game notification sounds all the same. With the 15 Pro you can at least set up automations that activate vibration mode for certains focus time of day locations and Bluetooth devices. You cant on all other iPhone because of the mute switch even if can be bypassed by software like the emergency bypass on the contactphone app. Its a dated feature that people seem to love but dont use it. I feel like it gives them a feeling of safety because its in mute mode with a switch its in mute mode for good like a circuit breaker. And like I said because of the lack of notifications customization instead of having custom recognizable notification sound for each app certains app on vibrations and some off regardless of it its better to be on vibration 9999999 of the time.,1,0,iphone15,17jhcbt,1,6,2023-10-30 01:21:29,Top,7,angry

3108,iPhone 15PM speaker issue,kbbvhzk,SimoGe83,Hi some days ago I received my 4th iPhone 15 Pro from Amazon...yes the fourth replacement. The first one was afflicted by the wellknown overheating so much that it couldnt be held against the cheek during a call... the update didnt solve the issue. The second device at maximum volume emitted a very annoying buzz from speakers during phone calls due to some internal vibration... in exchange for the 1369 I paid I expected a device without defects. Then the third iPhone arrived the problems with the speakerphones were identical to the second a buzz appeared while calling using the speakers as loudspeaker. I sent that iPhone back to Amazon and I bought another one...nothing changed also with the fourth device. This buzz occurs something like a vibration not a distortion or a clipping...its a clear vibration coming from the speakers or from the inside which is really annoying when using the speakerphone at maximum volume obviously I cant use the speakerphone by limiting the volume it would be a contradiction. When listening to music or vocal notes as well as recordings the vibration is still here but less perceived...,1,0,iphone15,17iqajt,9,14,2023-11-29 23:09:10,Top,15,frustrated

3195,Has anyone just started fresh insted of restoring from backup,k6s9m1j,xroalx,I just got my first iPhone yesterday but every time I had a new phone even previously I went fresh. Theres not too many settings I need to change and my overall experience with any kind of transfer or restore is that things get messed up every single time and then I feel like Ive just made a mess Im never going to clean up. Maybe its just Android in the past being not good at this maybe its just a feeling but it never bothered me to set up my device fresh. I actually prefer it as it allows me to just skip things I dont even need anymore and as you say maybe even discover theres something new now.,5,0,iphone15,17i6imc,5,7,2023-10-28 05:49:29,Top,12,ambivalent

The App Store will show you apps youve bought but that are not on a phone so no real need to screenshot etc though that would be a bit faster. You dont lose much time in getting things back since Messages are stored in iCloud and will sync email too. Passwords like you note in Keychain. Make sure youve stored full res photos in iCloud. The main time sink is if youre very particular about how you home screen and others are arranged and thats where the screenshot would be nice I guess. FWIW Ive not noticed a major difference in performance or battery life etc it has mostly been that doing a fresh install makes me think about what I want to reinstall and how its arranged.,2,0,iphone15,17i6imc,5,7,2023-10-28 16:45:46,Top,9,ambivalent

3203,To only charge to 80 or not,k6pqiqd,Dr904,Technically its better. But I dont think it makes too much of a difference with normal use. Where it matters more is for users that leave their iPhones on a charger for long periods of time even though its fully charged. Trickle charging back and forth between 99 and 100 for hours and hours wear down the battery a bit quicker. So for those users setting a limit at 80 will make a noticeable difference in the long run.,5,0,iphone15,17hrnjr,12,46,2023-10-27 18:20:21,Top,51,ambivalent
3204,To only charge to 80 or not,k6qpos4,Holla_99,Its still such a new feature that we dont really know if itll make a big difference just yet. Im using it but mainly because I have the 15 Plus and I want to see if it makes a difference in the long run or not. I have a habit of charging my phone overnight every night regardless of battery charge and my 15 Plus is still around 3040 of a charge at the end of the day on average even if I only charge to a max of 80. Im guessing if I had a regular 15 the phone would be close dead at the end of the day if I used the 80 charge limit so its probably not worth using on the normal size 15. Depends on your usage though. At the end of the day the batteries are replaceable so thats always an option if need be.,5,1,iphone15,17hrnjr,12,46,2023-10-27 22:02:38,Top,52,ambivalent

3207,To only charge to 80 or not,k6r5yyf,bbbb125,Assuming if you charge to 100 after two years of use battery health will be 90 and will degrade to 7580 for another two years. And if you charge to 80 after two years its 100 or only a little less. So with the first option you will use the full capacity for at least some time with the second option you will never use the full capacity. My previous phone was iPhone 11 and battery health is still 83. So I used more than 80 all the time if I limited it would be 80 or less for all time. Probably it makes sense if you plan to sell your phone after two years of use and want to get more for it.,2,1,iphone15,17hrnjr,12,46,2023-10-28 00:02:27,Top,49,ambivalent

Rather you should or shouldnt is really up to individual use cases. If your someone that ends up having your phone on a charger a lot through the day it makes a lot of sense or like me spend a lot of time in the car with the phone plugged in for CarPlay. In those scenarios maxing to 100 for long periods is not good. For typical users that charge at night and then off a charger all day predictably optimized charging works great. The algorithm doesnt handle unpredictable charging scenarios very well. Truth is these are small batteries and the cost to replace over three years is very small. Lithium batteries hate extremes extreme heat cold max charge max discharge. Now with large batteries like in cars these practices make a ton of sense.

Finished my first day of using the phone with 70 left. Can easily last 2 days of moderate use. 1 day for heavy usage. Even now im on 91 at 3pm from 100 at 8am 2. Battery life longevity. I used the xr for about 4 years now and honestly only in the 1st year did it last the whole day. So by my logic if the 15 can last a 12 days then in the long term at least i can use it one whole day. 3. Dynamic island placement. Iphone 15s dynamic island i feel protrudes more on the screen compared to my xr as the placement is a bit lower. Its minute but i noticed it. For the 15 you get the whole xr screen plus more and the dynamic island is up there. Plus it looks smaller on a bigger screen. 4.

3458,Which leather case is slimmer,k6ig431,matt_hipntechy,Im also in the process of looking for an iPhone 15 leather case. Heres my options and how I evaluated them Mujjo At first glance it looks good but I dont like the big Mujjo brand at the back of the case. Also I have read about many people returning it because it didnt meet their expectations. Nomad Ive used a Nomad leather case on my iPhone 12 mini. Its good quality and offers high protection. But it adds more weight and bulk compared to the Apple leather case and the plastic material on the sides doesnt feel as nice in the hands as leather. Id skip this. Bullstrap Looks nice but I dont like the open bottom and at 89 its too expensive. LONLI A decent looking and inexpensive option on Amazon that still seems to offer high quality leather and no branding at all. People seem very happy with it based on reviews. However on the images it looks thicker and heavier than other options. Andar To me it looks quite slim checks all the boxes and is reasonably priced. I believe this is the closest to the Apple leather case and likely the one people like you and I should get. However its preorder right now and will ship mid November.,2,1,iphone15,17gr1g5,7,6,2023-10-26 08:25:45,Top,9,ambivalent

One could argue this is even better than buying outright because you could put the money saved in a savings account. The Apple card will allow you to get an iPhone on a 24 month payment plan with 0 APR. The only thing you have to pay upfront are the taxes and then the activation fee for your carrier. Edit I have no idea which carrier would be the best for you though. It depends on where you live and what plans are offered. Since youre an international student maybe a prepaid carrier would be best like Cricket Mint or Boost Mobile.,3,0,iphone15,17gn1kh,3,30,2023-10-26 18:56:02,Top,33,ambivalent

3520,For this 15 that i got last week isnt the cycle count too high,k6mq1v2,TwoCables_from_OCN,Stop worrying about it. Stop looking at this. The way you use your iPhone determines how quickly you will go through charge cycles. The only way you can slow this down is by using your iPhone less. Heres how it works if you were to charge from 50 to 100 two times in a row then you complete one charge cycle. Or or if you were to charge from 25 to 100 and then you charged from 75 to 100 after that youd complete 1 charge cycle. Im using simple math on purpose just to keep it easy to understand. You could do 75 to 100 4 times in a row to complete 1 charge cycle. So you can see it just goes by math. Heres where I confuse most people though what I described above isnt describing TRUE charge cycles. A true charge cycle is 0 to 100 because it affects the entire battery instead of just a portion of it. All of my examples above are just portions. Even 5 to 100 is a portion albeit a huge one. So just stop worrying about it. Stop caring. Its just a battery. Just enjoy your iPhone Its absolutely useless to never charge to 100 or even to never charge to 80. Dont you think its inconvenient to be charging it so damn frequently Imagine how nice it would be to ONLY CHARGE WHILE YOURE SLEEPING Let it go to 100 while youre sleeping wake up unplug it and enjoy allday battery life. Imagine never having to charge while youre awake.,1,0,iphone15,17gojwt,0,24,2023-10-27 02:44:21,Top,25,frustrated

The terms iPhone Restore and restore your iPhone arent the same. An iPhone Restore is something you do in Finder in macOS or in iTunes for Windows. You go into your iPhone on the computer and you click iPhone Restore. This downloads the current version of iOS erases everything off the phone and starts it 100 fresh with a new installation of the current version of iOS. From there its like you just unboxed the iPhone and turned it on. So at that point restore from iCloud. When it gives you the option at the bottom in blue text to set your phone up without another device tap that option and then go from there. This will take just a few minutes longer than installing a new major version of iOS.,2,1,iphone15,17gg015,1,2,2023-10-26 03:24:16,Top,5,ambivalent

Apple state that refurbished devices have new batteries Refurbished iOS devices will come with new battery and outer shell. I would not pick a used phone from carrier or a seller. I have no proof that the battery was changed. It may have been a phone that was swapped after 6 month. The battery may still be at 100 but it may fall to 98 3 days after purchase. An article I cant put in a link says Before a refurbished phone is resold the battery will have been through rigorous testing to make sure its in full working order. In some cases this may mean that the battery has been replaced. But most of the time it will be the original battery that has been restored to its original condition In order word if it charges its all good. Thats it. TLDR If its from Apple yes. If the refurbished is not from Apple then I would pick a brand new iPhone 15.,2,1,iphone15,17e28o9,25,109,2023-10-23 00:25:23,Top,112,satisfied

I liked the 15 being 30 grams lighter than the same sized 14 pro and the 15 pro was on backorder for a month. So I got the 15 because it was available and 120hz and always on display which I do love dont matter as much on my iPhone because I also have 3 other android phones that all have it. But if it wasnt for the weight of the 14 pro and the wait of the 15 pro Id probably still have stuck with the pro. 15 isnt having the same overheating issues others are reporting which I guess is a plus. But honestly 800 got 60hz is ridiculous considering BLU just released a phone with a 120hz OLED display 66w charging with the wall brick cases and screen protector in the box all for 200. I went ahead and got it because I got a 150 discount because my friend bought it with my card whos an apple employee but honestly at full price its not worth it.,2,1,iphone15,16ukg7o,1,31,2023-09-28 21:41:52,Top,34,ambivalent

3917,Do any of you also have fear of missing out..,k3yzek2,KsnNwk,I have no fear of missing out I have fear of losing value. So when you buy the newest luxury tech thing be it car GPU iphone in this example iphone. They tend to lose most money the first year so 23 months before new iphone releases current model will lose almost 13 of its value ca 500600. Afterwards the 2nd year it only loses ca 150 a year. So going by this its better to go with last years model iphone when new one release or during holidays. That way I can upgrade more often but the urge for new shiny thing sometimes is overpowering. I was planning to go with 14 PM when 15PM releases it costing only 1050 instead of 1550. But then 15 PM has USBC auto portrait better HDR 5x zoom Action button. All features will help me out. So most normal people should get last years model you will be able to upgrade sooner and lose least value. But then I calculated the difference of price between 14PM vs 15PM when I deduce taxes since I get it for company. It ends up being like 300 and I can get 15PM for 0 fee installments while for 14PM I would need to shell out . So I just got the 15PM. Plus nowdays smartphones are peak so I will probably upgrade only when something revolutionary will come about.,2,1,iphone15,172vmz1,2,49,2023-10-08 10:30:03,Top,52,ambivalent

Looks cheap af new blue color looks lame and the titanium borders make it look inferior next to the shiny colors of my 12 pro max. Even the weight seems like a downgrade at first. I know I am missing out on a couple of new features but my main thing is the camera and I still can take bad ass pictures and videos with my 12p max.

What also may be the cause is user error as objects 12 inches or closer may cause the phone to punch into the 48MP main lens and crop to 5x which means its not using the 5x lens at all.,4,1,iphone15,16y33y6,0,20,2023-10-02 18:10:28,Top,25,disappointed

However the 15 Pros smaller size lighter weight and USBC made it worth the upgrade for me. Software wise my 13 Pro Max still ran amazingly as it should after only two years and if I had the regular 13 Pro I definitely wouldve kept it at least another year.,1,1,iphone15,17ardq8,1,31,2023-10-18 22:29:29,Top,33,ambivalent

I see ppl using to keep track of the flight but we survived without it so not a game changer. Titanium and round edge lighter smoother to hold. Case it up then only lighter.

After a few years it may already have reduced battery health. If you would be taking a lot of photos using the zoom lens the 13 pro and more storage would be nice. And the 13 pro can do 30fps pro res video but Im guessing that isnt a main factor upgrading from the X Note the 13 pro has a 3x optical zoom but the 15 base has the better 48mp base camera that provides full 12mp resolution at 2x zoom.

Also if you take lots of photos and care about photography then the 13P would be better for you especially with a bigger storage. The rest should be quite similar except that 13P is heavier. 15 has a more latest look with a dynamic island with a newer chip and the slightly better battery life which is mainly achieved due to the 60Hz display no Pro Motion.,1,0,iphone15,176yvyn,3,44,2023-10-13 23:44:51,Top,45,ambivalent

4127,Picked up the blue iPhone 15 today as well as the blue FineWoven case. What do you think,k2q26nu,theanimaster,I think the fine woven case is brilliant. Heres what no one is talking about 1. Material is all the same sides are impregnated with a grippy material. 2. the grippy material is nice in cases where if youre weird like me youre glued to YouTube even when taking a shower and the grippiness so far has been good enough to keep my iPhone on a tiled ledge and I sure dont want to test rumors of the fragility of the glass on my brand new iPhone 15 Pro Max 3. Did I mention it is grippy Definitely better than my leather cases from Apple. 4. I dont approve of the price this could easily be half of what the leather ones went for. 5. The finish is nice. Cloth on cloth feels good in the pocket and the texture carries through even on the grippy part. It doesnt feel cheap at all you can feel the texture on the lip of the case cheap cases dont have that attention to detail. You can even see the texture. But again its not just form the grippiness gives it function. 6. Action button is a PITA. I keep mistaking it for the volume up button but thats not the cases fault and probably the reason Apple only has one operational function for the action button and it requires a longpress. Overall its a price gouge for a solid functional product but so were the previous Apple leather cases which stained like no ones business. We have yet to see how this one holds up after a year. But Im impressed so far. I spend more on plastic crack from the likes of Games Workshop so yeah.

Theres little perks others have mentioned like refreshed battery life and whatever slight advances take place. Real thankful for usbc this year.

4307,iphone 15 pro max vs older models,k5a556d,IdaDuck,The notch never bothered me and static dynamic island doesnt really bother me either. However the reason I prefer DI is it takes the useless space and makes it functional. I like the ability to have a score or timer or whatever while Im doing other things with my phone. In terms of comparing your phone to a 12 pro max I would think the biggest differences would be pro motion and the camera quality. The 48 MP main shooter can grab a huge amount of detail especially in pro max or heif max.,2,1,iphone15,177g1g3,0,8,2023-10-17 17:03:19,Top,11,ambivalent

Fortunately Apple provides the tools at an incredible level of detail to turn useless4me features off. The best approach is simply to go though as many settings as possible and just turnoff the crap you dont use dont care about or are not currently using. Its first thing I do with a new phone and Ive always gotten Apples up to SOT spec at least on wifi and running lite apps. FWIW Apple also provides the tools to program your own automated custom charge optimization via shortcuts 10 smartplug to maintain that efficiency for years I personally keep my phonesbatt longer than Apple will support the iOS. So many different preferences and use cases combine with so many different settings that its best if everyone efficiencytunes for themselves.,3,0,iphone15,174haq0,2,5,2023-10-10 16:22:21,Top,8,ambivalent
4367,Optimisation of 15Pro,k4cr2gv,TwoCables_from_OCN,Ive tried using this phone with ProMotion turned off Settings Accessibility Motion Limit Frame Rate to on and its unpleasant. Its one of those things where once you experience it you dont want to stop experiencing it. So there are better ways to reduce power consumption than that. Like AutoBrightness. Go somewhere where you can have absolutely no light whatsoever like a room with no windows and no lights on. With AutoBrightness turned on set the brightness as low as it goes. This sort of calibrates AutoBrightness in a way where from that point forward it will always use a lower display brightness than it otherwise would if you hadnt done that. You can always reset this by toggling AutoBrightness off and back on. Use Dark Mode. I dont like Dark Mode but Dark Mode reduces power consumption because every OLED pixel is a bit like an individual incandescent light bulb but one where the color affects power consumption in addition to its brightness the darker the color is of a pixel the less power that pixel consumes and if its black its simply off So even at 100 brightness but nearly black a pixel is going to consume significantly less power than it would if it were some brighter color like ... white. At a very low brightness displaying a bright color such as white an OLED pixel still just sips power but of course it will consume far less if it were producing a dark color and so thats how Dark Mode can help reduce your average power consumption. Keep Bluetooth off when youre not using it. Not only does this reduce power consumption but it increases your phones security. However I get that for some people this is extremely inconvenient. So its just a suggestion. If your SIMeSIM allows for it go to Settings Cellular tap your SIM or eSIM Voice Data and enable LTE. I have 5G Auto 5G On and LTE. With 5G Auto its supposed to only use 5G when its needed for performance while optimizing battery life but it uses 5G far more than I expected like when using Google Maps for realtime navigation. smh Ive never had any Google Maps performance problems with LTE. heh Turn off Always On Display. I refuse to turn this off just to make a tiny reduction in my average power consumption because I freakin love this feature its a feature of convenience and luxury and sometimes of necessity but its another way you can reduce power consumption. Or you can make a very very very minor compromise in Settings Display Brightness Always On Display turn off Show Wallpaper. So the wallpaper area will be black and as you know when an OLED pixel is black its off in order to be black. You can also turn off Show Notifications to further reduce power consumption of Always On Display. Even so the refresh rate drops to 1 Hz when Always On Display is in use. So when the phone is in its sleep mode while Always On Display is enabled where the display would normally just turn off most people call this locked the refresh rate is at 1 Hz to help minimize power consumption. There are probably lots of other things you can do to reduce your average power consumption even further but I suspect they wouldnt make any noticeable difference. So really I think its best to just enjoy it asis,2,1,iphone15,174haq0,2,5,2023-10-11 00:42:53,Top,8,ambivalent

4377,Iphone 12 Pro to regular 15,k3axqfh,flowinginthewin,I made the upgrade. At the time the reason to get the 12 Pro was the base storage of 128Gb vs the regular 12. So Im a base user. Is it worth Depends. Theres not a thing I miss about the 12 Pro besides colors. The lack of LiDAR does not influence focus of photography and the measure app still works dont know if its less reliable. The brightness is VERY noticeable. Its visible on sunset. It was hard on the 12 Pro. The CPU upgrade is not noticeable. The battery is noticeable but I was at 92 health. But considering the 61 iPhones 12 lineup battery capacity was a joke 2815mAH smaller than the 11 its very noticeable considering its now 3300 maH. The weight is noticeable. I like the weight loss. The big question remains about the zoom. You loose the telephoto lenses no matter if Apple says you get a 2x optical zoom on the 15 youre not its digital cropping. I will say this I tried to take the same picture that I took at 2x two years ago on my 12 Pro at around the same distance. Result the mailbox seemed to have kinda a LITTLE more details on the 12 Pro shot. But I zoomed a lot to notice that. So have this in mind. Its kinda equal. The dynamic island is cute but not a life changer. Horizontal Face ID unlock was used quite often. Its nice. USBC is a blessing and a nightmare. I had to dig my box to get USB C cables to put on my chargers. However you can finally buy USBC accessories. Now with this in mind you can make the choice if its financially worth make this upgrade. Without money in mind I would say its worth an upgrade. A battery swap is almost always the best option to make financially.,1,0,iphone15,16yjkbg,0,21,2023-10-03 16:36:56,Top,22,ambivalent

4438,For those who went 14 Pro 15 or 15 plus,k4ycrww,Musashi_19,I have the same problem. Im having a dillema whether I should change my 14 pro for the newly released 15 base model. I can sell my current pro for around what the 15 costs so I most likely wouldnt lose any money in the process. Ever since I got the 14 pro Ive been bothered by its weight and clunkyness. After using in for like 5 minutes the lower half of my hand gets numb and sharp corners make it more difficult to use with one hand. Its also really heavy to carry in pockets so I pretty much completely resort to using bags now. Pros much lighter phone pink I would def buy a pro model if if came in pink slightly rounded corners that make it easier to hold usb c new device experience new battery better main camera Cons no 120hz display no real difference in usability current battery is at 98 which means its stilll very good no third camera So far for me the most important arguments for is weight and color against is lack of 120hz. On one hand I wanna get the 15 on the other hand I dont wanna feel like im making a mistake and downgrading,1,1,iphone15,177v972,11,40,2023-10-15 08:38:09,Top,42,ambivalent

4452,What features require a 256gb storage,k3jzs2u,KsnNwk,On 15 Pro you can plug in SSD through usb c slot and still record ProRes Raw 4K 60FPS with 128GB model. Otherwise you only can 1080p 60fps. But with 256gb you can do that without the SSD So if you are the go you can do ProRes Raw 4K 60fps for slow motion. With 14 Pro you cannot plug in a SSD so you are stuck with only 1080p ProRes on 128GB version. For non Pro it doesnt matter. Its really a feature only meant for professionals who knows what they are doing and the best camera is the one you have nearby. While otherwise for professional gigs they have 20003000 cameras. For normal people its better to use HEIF for normal size files and iPhone processing. They will be what most people use for still photos for low light videos you will want to use 12mp anyway.,6,1,iphone15,170brq5,3,10,2023-10-05 10:07:54,Top,17,ambivalent

My thought process was that I would be using it as a secondary work phone and wouldnt be needing as much storage as my main device. The day I got my phone and set it up with only the applications that I needed and made the files I needed for work available offline from my iCloud. It filled up the storage so fast I immediately got the running low on storage pop up. Instant Regret. I managed to use the device for a year but it was always a workaround. That was the day I realised that more is better. I always go with higher storage a little extra storage hurt no one.

Hated how heavy the 14 Pro was my 13 mini spoiled me I weighed the pros and cons before I did this and it came to the point where I couldnt justify spending more money on the pros every year. I dont take a lot of photos just casual shots here and there. So I do t even use the third camera. 120hz is nice but I get over that quickly since I use a 13 mini as well. Not a deal breaker.

4524,iPhone 15 users hows it going,k46rlq1,T00_muCh_cUriosity,I bought the iPhone 15 pro blue titanium with 256G of storage. It was an absolute ride trying to get this thing lol. I have a kind of strict transaction limit on my debit card so buying online wasnt an option. I called so so so many places within an hour of a half from me received many nos and for places that did have a pro model it was the good ol black 128g version. Im someone who keeps a phone for quite a few years so I wasnt going to go for it but eventually I caved. Drove an hour and 20 minutes away had the physical cash and for some reason the system denied the transaction. There was no sort of skepticism surrounding the cash and it 100 was real cash from the bank. Anyways very long story short I found a way to order it online and got it in two days. Despite all of that I have absolutely no regrets coming from an iPhone SE 2020. I love high end tech and damn this thing is nice. Ive done quite a bit of gaming with no disappointments the pictures are absolutely amazing and it works as a phone.

4590,Is it worth it Xiaomi vs Iphone,k9qwzxo,titiwon,I recently bought an iphone 15 the normal one and swtiched from Android and I totally regret. Let me pinpoint some of the downsides I found 1. The UI is very clunky. It does not have a backwards button. How ridiculous is to slide upwards to go to the tabs menu or having to find backwards arrows and crosses to exit tabs or processes. Does not matter the processor the user experience ends up being slower. 2. Android applications work worse. For example I am an active google map user and same thing as 1st. Having to do touches slides and other things to access menus and other things difficult the usage. 3. Android applications work worse. Another example is whatsapp be ready to loose your chats. It is so pathetic you cannot download your google drive backups. There are 3rd party softwares to bring those chats to the iphone. For that you need to allow a 3rd party to decrypt all your messages and handle your data. I would not recommend that. 4. The camera. Total dissapoinment. Main camera In the night it underperforms with my super old xiaomi remi 8 pro. In the day obviously way more beautiful than my redmi but sometimes texts and other things are not so well captured. Front Camera simply horrible seems a bit blurry. Forget about details like hairs. Almost as bad as my redmi 8 pro. 5. Apple wants to hook you up by all means with shareabilty applications. I must say airdrop is very good big shoutout. tltr IOS UI is bad and the experience is slow in spite of the processor. Camera is not that impressive depending what kind of pictures you want. You will not be able to migrate 100 all your data and apps to IOS be ready to leave things behind.,1,1,iphone15,173ntf4,4,10,2023-11-18 09:18:35,Top,12,disappointed

The 15 is lighter comes in the color you want will be brand new with new Warranty And new battery. You also get USBC charging which is a huge advantage. You wont miss 120hz after a day.

I know what you mean about the sharp edges cutting into your hand I used to hate it. Go for the 15 and sell your 14 to offset some of the 15s cost. Oh and the 120 vs 90....youll not notice it.

Other than that you should estimate how much storage you can reduce V.S how much storage you can gain over the next 3 years. If you calculate that you will bust 128Gb after 3 years get 256Gb. Note that iPhone 15 photos take by default more space because it has 24MP photos. It can be made to 12MP if you want.,3,0,iphone15,176k3ss,8,20,2023-10-13 00:06:20,Top,23,satisfied

If iPhone 13 battery life is sufficient for you then 256GB iPhone 15 would make sense. The 15 Plus size can be unwieldy and 128GB storage wont fix your issue unless if you will subscribe to the iCloud service.

Also 120 vs 60 screen is a personal preference it might not matter to you. The plus has a bigger battery so somewhat better battery life but dont fall prey to the battery life blues of a lot of folks posting who seem to figure the pros battery life is horrible.

4883,Torn between getting the 15 Plus and the 15 Pro,k57zb89,Ljecker31,Plus is just a bigger screen for a cheaper price because a lot of users didnt want to spend too dollar for a pro max if they wouldnt use it for all its glory. The pro granted smaller has more bells and whistles the main attraction being the camera. I find the 6.12 inch display to be my favorite as it doesnt feel like a brick in the hand or taking up a majority of your pocket like the 6.7 inch screens. In short ask yourself what you use your phone for. If you enjoy taking photos and videos lean towards the pro. If you just want a bigger screen so it is easier to see and dont care to use every feature a phone comes with nowadays go for the plus. You got to recognize your wants and how you use your phone now to decide and justify which one you want. I work in phone sales and asking the customer Im working with these questions help them decide what they believe is the best fit for them.,3,0,iphone15,179mpdk,15,54,2023-10-17 05:16:04,Top,57,ambivalent

Are you gonna take advantage of faster data transfer speeds and attach an external hard drive to your phone via USBC to record log footage Do you absolutely need a 120hz display Or do you prefer a bigger phone and better battery life The difference between the base and pro models is so minute this year which is a good thing I went with the base model 15 and dont feel like Im missing out on any pro features. Apple is really good at making you think that youll grow into a pro phones features but then it never happens and you kinda wish you saved a little money and made a different choice. Not saying this happens for everyone but it does for a lot of people My coworker was convinced that he needed the 15 Pro Max but hes used the camera on his 11 Pro Max only a handful of times... I asked him these same questions and he ended up with the 15 Plus and couldnt be happier. At the end of the day though go to a store and see which one you like the feel of in your hand. The 120hz display alone could be the thing that makes you go for the pro.,2,0,iphone15,179mpdk,15,54,2023-10-17 11:38:29,Top,56,happy

So Ive decided to let the order stand and trust Apple. What worries me more is the odd change to a frame and design that allows the iPhone to bend easily and break the glass too easily. Theres a hollow space behind the back glass that makes it easy to break...even by hand. I thought that titanium and hardest glass ever would make this the first iPhone in a long time that Id use bare. But no. LOL.... Had to back up and order a case after all.

For typical users most people only notice the improved screen always on display and dynamic island maybe. If you are happy with the 12 keep rocking it My wife doesnt really see that much difference with the 15 pro max and her previous X but she is about as far from tech savvy as you can get. That being said I am upgrading to the 15 pro max only because I really missed the 6.7 screen size I always had plus size phones before the 12 pro and USB C is a great addition for my use case.

5051,Considering buying but have some concerns,k5jsqxp,TwoCables_from_OCN,1. Dynamic Island is never a problem for me. I love it. I think the sides are blacked out to prevent the Dynamic Island from being visible. Ive never seen the Dynamic Island while watching videos. 2. I have only used iPhones. 3. Whether its impressive probably depends on what youre used to. I think its worth every penny. Since Ive only used iPhones I dont know what to point out to someone coming from Android but I dont see any need to worry about issues. As for advantages I guess youll have to wait to see what others say who can speak about coming from Android. One thing I guess I should know though is you will never again have to worry about closing apps to manage your systems memory. Like ever. You can leave every app you have installed open and it wont cause any problems. With Android I assume this is still a problem in 2023.,3,1,iphone15,17bjlhp,11,47,2023-10-19 14:28:04,Top,51,ambivalent
5052,Considering buying but have some concerns,k5k5twt,autistic_prodigy28,I was in a similar situation like you when I switched from a samsung to iPhone and I would just say it depends on how you want to use the phone 1 yes the island pill is annoying while watching full screen stuff. Its utility is rather limited too but its better than the old notch on the previous models. You arent really going to notice it in regular use but you will while watching content. 2 like I said it depends. What do you want from your phone If you want the os to be smooth and reliable then ios is better. But if you want the freedom of choosing what to do with your phone then androids are wayy better. The keyboard on iPhone sucks and Im surprised you cant change it without downloading another. You cant move your apps on the home screen to a more reachable area. You cant even download anything outside the app store unless you decide to sideload which is a tedious task anyway. You cant download apks whichs the thing I missed the most but if youre ok with these stuff then the ios will probably not be that bad for you. It will take some time to get used to tho. 3cant say cuz i literally came from a 4 yr old 30k phone to an 80k one. The quality is unquestionably better but idk how it compares to other flagships for same price,2,1,iphone15,17bjlhp,11,47,2023-10-19 15:50:05,Top,50,ambivalent
5053,Considering buying but have some concerns,k5kbodo,QWufflez,Honestly think about it carefully. I just switched and there a lot of small things that really bother me. Transfer is easy theres an app that sends over media and supposedly a list of apps. Roughly 23 apps showed up on iOS and were quickly downloaded. But 13 I had to search and manually Install. No biggie. iOS feels cool but very limited. Apple tells you how to use your device. You have to adept to their workflow design many things can not be adjusted. Keyboards on iOS suck. I used to have a keyboard where I could long press for symbols like question mark on certain buttons. This seems to not be possible on iOS. Also the comma key is not on main keyboard but you have to switch via 123 button to symbols. Havent found an option to enable dedicated key on main keyboard either. Swiping feels less accurate. Again tried multiple Gboard is my favorite so far. Notifications on the top screen are not a thing. Small icon of email or WhatsApp for unread notifications. Only in Lockscreennotficaion Screen. Control Center swiping top right down to have quick settings turn of wifi or so is rather limited. Cant turn on hotspot from there cant toggle vibration settings quickly. You cant move the home screen its always the most left screen used to have it centered and then to the left one kind of apps to the right other kind of apps Back gesture is finicky. Have to reach to the left most position cant change it to the other side like on Android. Also some apps dont support back swiping have to use top left corner. The pillisland also is weird. Havent had one before it bothered me quite a bit. But Im getting used to it slowly. Still seems very odd they cant implement a better solution like everyone else... Customization is also more limited. You want to rotate background every 10 Minutes or other costum time Nope 1h or 24h only. Browser extensios only on safari Quickly to settings from anywhere pull down and press settings Nope not an option.. Those are just some to iOS users these seem unnecessary or they didnt even think that would be possible but thats the way I had my work flows setup. If you dont want to you didnt have to use it Like thus. That was the beauty of android everyone can use it as they want. Not on iphone though.

5058,Considering buying but have some concerns,k5k3vmf,SochieLife,Few things. One I went from the iPhone 6s to the Galaxy S8 then to the 11 pro currently on the 15 plus and when I migrated my stuff it wasnt a huge issue. The biggest thing for me was pictures but all of them were backed up from google photos which was nice my contacts also all transferred over as well. The majority of the stuff nowadays is cloud based so migrating from one to another isnt terrible. As for the dynamic islandpill cut out I love it. So much better than the notch. Compared to the hole cutout in androids yes its bigger but I dont mind it especially how Apple has utilized it. Most YouTube videos are bezeled before the island until you use zoom to fill. Even when using zoom to fill its not that big of a deal. Sometimes I like using it just to see the pill cutout its a weird quirk of mine. And for the 60Hz its not bad. Ive seen 120 and yeah you notice a difference but IOS is so optimized for the most part that it still feels snappy and fast,1,1,iphone15,17bjlhp,11,47,2023-10-19 15:38:12,Top,49,satisfied
5059,Considering buying but have some concerns,k5kin4e,wbbly_juniper,I switched from a Samsung s20fe to an iPhone 15 base model 1. At some point you kinda forget that its there and you get used to it its not such a big deal for me anyway 2. There is some getting used to the transition was easy I just had to reinstall a couple of the apps that Im not sure why they did not transfer directly. Its gonna sound weird but there are small things that I miss that I did not realise I will for example being able to see the notification icons in the status bar I really dont like how the notifications work on iOS. I find that the settings are not as intuitive as android but at the same time I was a long time user of android someone here said that you need to kinda rewrite your brain because they are two different systems and its normal for them to not be the same. 3. Looove the camera for me it was worth it but why I made the switch is not necessarily the camera but the fact that the system just works which Im very happy with. I somehow always have issues with android and I was sick of it and just wanted something that worked Hope this helps,1,1,iphone15,17bjlhp,11,47,2023-10-19 17:06:27,Top,49,happy

5061,Considering buying but have some concerns,k5m3cqe,icrackcorn,I was an Android Galaxy user from 2016 up until a couple of weeks ago to an iPhone 15 Pro. The dynamic island when watching some wider videos is a little bit annoying compared to a small punch out but its fine. You barely notice it. The battery life is WAY better. I was on a S21 where on heavy use days I would for sure have to charge my phone in the evening or else it would die. There is no way I would have gone to sleep with a 10 charge because my S21 would die overnight and Id miss my alarm. The iPhone has enough battery to last more than a full day and maybe only discharge 1 overnight unplugged. Things run overall smoother. I already had AirPods before the iPhone. The integration is much nicer. Face ID fingerprint You lose a ton of customization on iOS. I miss being able to resize widgets. I miss icon swipe functions that I had set up on Nova launcher. I used to use a GPS spoofer on my Galaxy phone to be able to trick certain apps that you cant do on iOS. Sideloading is possible on iOS but is a PITA whereas on Android its dead simple. Notifications are better on Android. In the end both iOS and Android have some things that are done better or worse. Both SamsungGoogle and Apple make great phones and software. Im very happy with my new iPhone but if it got stolen tonight and I had to go back to my old Galaxy S21 its not like Id be super upset with having to switch back.,1,1,iphone15,17bjlhp,11,47,2023-10-19 22:57:47,Top,49,happy

I wouldnt have paid 1100 for it but for about 300 its totally worth it. I like it just fine. Its certainly a big step up from the 12 Pro. I havent had any issues with heat or battery or anything. My phones dont bend because I dont sit on them. The 15 Pro gets no hotter than my 12 Pro did and the battery lasts a lot longer as one would expect for a new battery versus one three years old.

I had a 13 pro max before and those were really heavy Also I wish the plus had the pro motion display but after a bit of reading it seems people get used to it after a day and its not a major concern,7,2,iphone15,16sz3tj,12,38,2023-09-26 21:34:06,Top,47,ambivalent

5232,iPhone 15 Pro or 15 plus,k2c6aez,Dr904,I was first thinking about getting the 15 Pro. But might actually go for the 15 Plus instead. I know its lacking ProMotion and telephoto camera. But honestly. ProMotion on iPhone has been inconsistent and stuttery anyway. I might miss the telephoto a little bit but I guess 2x is good enough for portrait photos. The positive things on the other hand. Much MUCH better battery life Its slightly cheaper. Seemingly doesnt overheat like the 15 Pro. It only weigh 14 grams more despite being much larger. So it will feel super light and comfortable for the size.,6,2,iphone15,16sz3tj,12,38,2023-09-26 20:50:13,Top,46,ambivalent

I download some playlists take lots of pictures. Still have plenty of left over room. I also have 200 gb iCloud for additional storage. If you keep your phone for a long time 256 gb might be more future proof. Unfortunately whatever storage you buy with iPhone youre stuck with.

5277,Will 128gb be enough for casual use,k3upz0w,Holla_99,256GB is always the safer bet especially if you plan on keeping the phone for several years. Ive made the mistake several times in the past where I got the smallest available storage cause at the time it sounded like plenty I also had a extremely limited budget at the time unlike this year. After a good few years that minimum storage is usually not enough anymore and I have to sacrifice a good bit of content I wish I had on my phone. That being said it really does depend on your use. My Mom and I both came from older 64GB phones both are casual users I just have more content. She had used approx. 2030GB on her old phone max. While I knew I had surpassed its storage as I had to take my complete music collection off the phone so it wasnt full. She got a 128GB 15 Plus and has tons of space and I got the 256GB. Turns out my content takes up just a bit over the 64GB that my old phone was so 256 seems overkill right now but since I want to keep this phone for at least 5 years or more I feel safer about getting 256. If you are on a tight budget then you can probably get away with 128GB but it will become very frustrating if you ever do run out of storage. If you want to future proof and be on the safe side and can afford it definitely get 256.,1,2,iphone15,171wbc3,26,73,2023-10-07 13:57:46,Top,76,frustrated

5343,Heating issue,k2pxjy9,General_Kiwi5277,For the sake of context Im on my 5th day of owning my iPhone 15 Pro. The only heating incident I had was on the first day I owned it and I had plugged it in to charge. I know it is normal for it to get warm when fast charging but the amount of heat it had generated was way more than just simply warm. Im surprised it didnt shut itself off because it was almost as hot as a literal fireball. Despite that I didnt think too much of it because I know when you set up a new device it has to do some indexing in the background and download stuff from iCloud which I know can cause your device to heat and it drains battery faster. Thankfully that process is temporary. Aside from that I havent had any heating issues since then. I charged it last night and while it was expectedly warm from fast charging it definitely didnt get nowhere near as hot as it did the first night when I was charging it.

I preordered mine and got it in 7 days. But even one hour into ordering shipping dates were into late October already. It isnt shipping it is all because they cant make the phone fast enough this year. Nobody has stock not even Apple I dont think. I could be wrong about Apple not having stock just a guess. I always order from Apple because guaranteed to get it a lot faster than from a carrier. Ordering from Apple you have the ability to choose a carrier and sometimes can get better deals. When trading in a phone always go to Apple because they will give you the max trade in for your phone. These are my opinions.,1,2,iphone15,171z4g5,6,7,2023-10-07 09:15:28,Top,10,frustrated

The vast majority of people are putting cases on so in reality what are you actuating basing your colour choice on is the camera area. If you go caseless or clear case then it makes sense to pick the colour you really prefer. And yes I am one of those people who was undecided on the colour of the iPhone too. I went Pro Max Natural Titanium and Im now deciding if I want to go caseless or clear case.

This years pro version wasnt worth the price for me personally it seems more geared towards content creators or people who intend on playing mobile games on their iPhone. After about 2wks since launch I saw reviews etc of the 15 pro and all the issues. During my lunch break I decided to go to an Apple Store and check out the new iPhones side by side.

Even though they issued a software update it seems the new A17 isnt fully baked as its the first 3nm chip in a cell phone. The pro being 3nm and having a variable refresh rate it should have better battery life than the regular 15 with the older chip but it doesnt. So I got the regular 15 in matte black. Always wanted matte black LOVE the lightness compared to my old 13 pro and got used to 60 hz in 5 minutes.,3,0,iphone15,17aijme,18,59,2023-10-18 15:03:06,Top,62,frustrated

Found myself not using the zoom camera as much and the 15 plus has x2 optical zoom anyways and as other people are saying for the features we dont typically need they are right. As much as I love gaming gaming on your phone will murder your overall battery health in the long run which is the biggest reason why I wouldnt be playing AAA games on it. And I feel that base model iPhones and pros are closer than ever this year and feels like I didnt miss out. I feel a big part of that was the front display by adding the dynamic island and the 2000 nit brightness. Finally with the 200 I saved nearly 300 from going plus to pro max I used the money and upgraded my gen 1 AirPods to the AirPod pro 2 usb c which I have 0 regrets. If someone is thinking about getting the regular pro I would go with the 15 plus just from sheer size and battery health alone,3,1,iphone15,17aijme,18,59,2023-10-18 15:31:09,Top,63,satisfied

5456,Does anybody think the AlwaysOn Display and Telephoto lense are worth an extra 350 between the 15 and 15PM Canadian dollars already includes tax,k4nxaq4,TwoCables_from_OCN,Hell no. 350 is not worth it for these 2 features unless 350 is like pocket change for you. Yknow Can you do a tradein to significantly reduce the cost I got a 700 tradein with my carrier Xfinity for my iPhone 11 and Always On Display is one of the reasons why I chose iPhone 15 Pro over the 15. The other is ProMotion because it makes all movement buttersmooth and I just love it. If I were paying full price though then Id still have iPhone 11. Or if my tradein were like say half as much then I wouldve had to settle for the 15 and I wouldnt have felt comfortable playing with the Pro model at the Apple Store because then Id have found out what I couldnt have. Once I tried the Pro model I immediately decided there was no way I would go back to considering the 15. Anyway I love Always On Display. Ive been using Tap to Wake since September 2019 and so Im extremely happy to finally put that to an end. Now my Lock Screen is always glanceable To decide if its worth 350 more to you just to have this and a Telephoto camera pay attention to how often you wake your phone just to see the Lock Screen and consider whether not having to do that would be worth 350 extra and also pay attention to how often youd strongly prefer to zoom in with an actual Telephoto camera to get true optical zooming up to 5x. These 2 things would most definitely not be worth it for me. 350 is a ton of money to me. I think these 2 things would be worth about 50 more though. For sure. Or maybe 100 more. Also consider how important photo and video quality is to you though. Ive seen people say that they think theres an obvious difference between a photo and video taken with a 15 vs. a 15 Pro. Just at 1x For some reason I didnt test the cameras at the store. These arent the only differences to consider of course. The Pro models have the Action Button which I love I just use it for the Flashlight though because with how I use my iPhone this is what I decided I want the Action Button to do but knowing what else it can do thanks to this article and video adds a ton of value to this phone for me. Even so just being able to reliably turn the flashlight on and off is a big upgrade for me. Have you ever had a failed on or off for the flashlight from the Lock Screen It was a frustratingly daily occurrence for me. It wasnt reliable. Another thing to consider is whether youd want the ability to do professionallevel editing of your photos and videos thanks to ProRAW and Apple ProRes. To some people this is worth the higher cost of the Pro series all by itself. Not for me though. However this combined with the superior camera system is the main contributing factor to the higher cost. I think in addition to that the build quality is up there in the major contributing factor category. I dont think Always On Display and a Telephoto camera really adds to the cost so much that its 350 more just for those 2 things Or maybe the Telephoto camera does add a significant amount to the cost but I think the 350 difference is largely due to ProRAW ProRes and just the generally how much better the photo and video quality is and the build quality of the phone. So yeah I think it would be unwise to pay 350 more just to have Always On Display and a Telephoto camera unless youd value those so highly that youd never regret paying that much more just to have those 2 features while possibly not caring about all the others.,6,1,iphone15,176ouob,6,21,2023-10-13 04:24:14,Top,28,ambivalent

Couldnt be happier. Im not a pro user and I get that if you have a need for that the pro max is a great phone. I take as many photos as the next person but dont need to shoot a movie on my phone and any iPhone from the last several years takes great photos. I really wanted a pink plus at launch but they didnt have any but I was able to return the pro max and get the one I wanted so I did it. No regrets. And the always on display is not as well implemented on iOS as it is on android so I turned it off. I have tap and raise to wake enabled so its easy enough to see my screen at a glance if I need to. Its super handy on my Apple Watch but not so much on my phone.

Since Ill be using this phone for several years I decided to splurge to go for the Max over the Plus. For me AOD the telephoto lens extra RAM 120Hz display 256gb starting storage better camera hardware and software newer processor faster USBC speeds the action button and new build quality were worth the extra. Those two features alone make it tougher to justify the 350 CAD expense. However you have to see if the other differences add up and make sense especially with your budgetwallet in mind. If the other features make sense for you then Id go for the Pro Max. If not then the Plus is the way to go. Cant go wrong with the Plus because it has tons of good features like the best battery life on any 15 series iPhone a 2x optical zoom without the need of a telephoto lens good camera upgrades from prior models dynamic island super bright display to see outside etc.,2,0,iphone15,176ouob,6,21,2023-10-13 17:03:46,Top,23,happy

5470,15 plus difference to 14 pro max,k24tbxv,TPM_521,All Ive heard about the 15 pro max overheating is purely anecdotal from a single YouTube reviewer who said it was overheating when editing video onboard which is a super specific use case and IMO something most people probably wont do if theyre really shooting ProRes and using the footage for professional purposes since editing is SO much easier and faster on a desktoplaptop computer. I think its almost always worth getting the latest gem when you upgrade. I just upgraded from an X to a 15 Pro Max. Any savings you may get buying a 14 right now will be offset in the relative loss youll see when trading in your phone. Plus USBC will future proof you for several years. You kept an iPhone 8 for this long youll be keeping your next phone for a while too Id imagine and by then I can basically guarantee you that most of you peripherals and day to day accessories will be on USBC. It will be convenient to have that usability with your phone as well. I have had no issues with my phone personally Ive only had it since yesterday evening so I cant really say Ive put it through the ringer but its more than capable of handling day to day activities. Unless youre gaming or doing other very CPUheavy tasks like editing videos on your phone I cant imagine the overheating issue will ever present itself to you.,6,0,iphone15,16rmxrw,5,9,2023-09-25 13:28:08,Top,15,ambivalent

5487,iphone 15 pro gets extremely hot and drains battery when on a call.,k2jzt3j,memezgalorz,quick update I went to the apple store today and this is what the genius bar told me First thing he said was this is an issue that is being faced by many 15 Pro users and is even happening to his phone but not to the extent that it is happening on my phone and he said although it is under warranty I cant exchange it for 2 weeks as the phone is brand new and they need at least 2 weeks of diagnostics to be able to make sure there is an issue with the phone which in my opinion is silly as theres clearly a problem with my phone. me and my friend bought the same phones from the same place same specs etc. we put them side by side and called each other and his phone was completely normal while mine was pretty much a stove. the genius bar guy factory reset my phone which seems to have solved the issue as now the phone doesnt overheat unless Im on a call for over an hour which is an improvement as before that it would overheat in about a minute and even when it does overheat its not to the point where I cant hold the phone anymore. he also said this is a SOFTWARE issue. if it doesnt completely resolve in the next 2 weeks then ill be exchanging my phone for a new one and I advise everyone thats facing this issue to do the same.,6,1,iphone15,16tqrwh,19,29,2023-09-28 09:41:18,Top,36,frustrated

I do struggle when using it in bed to reach all the corners when composing in an app. My body wants to go back to the nonMax. In practice this 15 Pro Max is just fine. Keeping it but at times im on the fence. USBC is just superb. All in all its an excellent and flawless device. No overheating. No random shut downs. Plenty fast.

5544,iPhone 15 pro or 15 pro Max,k5e3mt8,NiceAd1435,x200B Whether to choose the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max depends on your personal preferences and needs. The main differences between the two models are the size of the display and the battery life. The iPhone 15 Pro Max has a larger display and a longer battery life than the iPhone 15 Pro. If you prefer a larger display and a longer battery life then the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the better choice. However if you are looking for a more compact phone or if you are on a budget then the iPhone 15 Pro is still a great option. It has the same powerful A17 Bionic chip and the same camera system as the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

All iPhones can be used for 2 years. At 3 year or before you will likely need a battery swap. After 5 or 6 years it will not have the latest software features but still get major security flaws patch. Your iPhone 13 mini is still good today. I would have recommended the 15 Plus since you mentioned eyesight but coming from a 13 mini the difference in size may be too big so get the 15.,5,1,iphone15,16v8xpn,8,22,2023-09-29 14:18:12,Top,28,ambivalent

Theres a lot of talk on Reddit about the Pro model tech enthusiasts usually want the top of the line but the nonPro 15 is a great phone in its own right. Its the latest phone from Apple. Now its not as much of an upgrade from a 13 mini in terms of specs just size. But its a fine upgrade nonetheless.

5567,15 or 15 pro,k218g1d,TinkatonSmash,I went from 12 Pro Max to regular 15. My reasons for switching was that I didnt like the size and especially the weight of the 12PM. Both the 15 and 15P are smaller and lighter than the 12PM but the 15 is about 10 lighter than the 15P. If youre coming from a Mini you will probably care about weight as well. I also didnt think the extra features of the Pro were worth 200 to me but if you take a lot of pictures want the always on display or play a lot of mobile games the Pro might be well worth it to you.,3,1,iphone15,16qn5a9,8,25,2023-09-24 19:22:38,Top,29,ambivalent

A YouTube test showed 15 Plus having the best battery followed by Pro Max regular 15 then 15 Pro at bottom. Not that the battery was bad on any of them and will be a massive improvement from the Mini youre coming from.

5569,15 or 15 pro,k22okek,mrmgn3t,I know everyone is saying pro but hear me out. The 15 plus is looking really good this year. As reviews come out Im questioning getting a pro. The pros are getting super hot due to the chip draining a lot of battery especially the regular pro the pro max apparently will break its back glass if you bend it hard enoughnot an issue with the previous models. The plus has the best battery since the 13PM upgraded camera with better hdr and auto portraitnot included in the 14 pro. The 15pros chip is better but gets so hot that it will throttle so gaming and intense camera stuff suffers. The only real reason to get a pro is if you want pro motion which to me is a very justifiable reason.,2,0,iphone15,16qn5a9,8,25,2023-09-25 00:52:51,Top,27,ambivalent

The obvious answer is obviously the Pro for 999 of cases if the phone size are equal the 01 is those where weight is the most important factor. We dont know your finances and priorities. So are you willing to spend the 200 USD for the features that the Pro gives you over the regular 15 Dont forget that although you may have some USBC cables that hangs around you will need to have new cables everywhere if needed car battery bank wall charger other charger that hangs around for PC and MAC etc.,1,0,iphone15,16qn5a9,8,25,2023-09-24 21:44:04,Top,26,frustrated

5604,iphone 15 of iphone 15 pro,k34c99s,AtypicalNerdGeek,I used to be a snooty Pro user and I perhaps would have been if it werent for the supply shortages for the Pro Max. Because I couldnt get hold of one I settled for a 15 Plus and I couldnt be happier. I thought I would miss the 120 Hz display the Pros camera system but I actually find myself surprised I was even so bothered with it. For the added battery life barely any heat I dont see myself envy those with a Pro model again. Sometimes less is more and having all those zoom options did confuse me a bit at times. I am pleased with x1 x2 zoom which comes with the base models. I spend less time worrying about what angle and zoom is the best for the scene and take more images which I can crop in with the 24MP final image. I havent really suffered a downgrade to 60 Hz display either which I was most concerned about. In fact the only place it is noticeable is app transitions openclose and swiping between app pages. Its very easy to get used to to my surprise. I gotta say I dont think Ill be looking for a Pro model again unless there is a significant attention to the weight weight balance of the devices as I find the cameras to weigh it down a lot particularly when crammed into a smaller Pro shape. The larger Pro Max have always some how felt lighter in the hand due to its wider weight distribution. Anyhow I hope this helps you in your choice.

5605,iphone 15 of iphone 15 pro,k30avla,906darkroast,I think the battery and heat issues will be resolved with software so it comes down to how much you value the better120 screen chip cam performance etc. The base 15 is great and would serve you well. Its battery will be slightly better long term imo. Since you clearly hang on to phones coming from an 8 you may choose to future proof and cop this years chip over last years. It just depends on you. I sat in your same shoes upgrading from an 8 and ultimately cancelled an initial base 15 order and got a 256gb 15 pro in natural titanium. Money wasnt a factor in my decision either. Theres no wrong answer here.,2,0,iphone15,16x3drf,8,31,2023-10-01 15:18:00,Top,33,ambivalent

5607,iphone 15 of iphone 15 pro,k31p5q7,CPAFinancialPlanner,Apple is sneaky smart. They know if they put Pro motion on the regular phone there would be no purpose for anyone to buy the regular Pro especially since the PM has a better camera. So they can essentially charge an extra 200 for a feature that should be standard in 2023. They need to start bringing more features to the regular pro once the standard gets promotion in 2 years.,2,1,iphone15,16x3drf,8,31,2023-10-01 20:20:14,Top,34,frustrated

5609,iphone 15 of iphone 15 pro,k308xfx,Bluefoxgirl1,The plus series is the one individuals like for battery performance Than you have Max Pro series that eats up battery usage. The iPhone line is still being service and updated quickly daily to run smoothly and we will see how that plays out in the coming weeks and months but for now the plus is best for long term usage. Bugs are not as prevalent on the lower device models. The IPhone OS updates Apply is pushing out is covering the overheating issues and will soon be converted problem going forward on the iPhone 15 series line and hopefully eliminating CPU surge workoverload heating issues.,1,1,iphone15,16x3drf,8,31,2023-10-01 15:04:58,Top,33,ambivalent

5611,iphone 15 of iphone 15 pro,k34c5lw,TwoCables_from_OCN,The iPhone 15 Pro hands down the better choice. It has A better camera system which is saying a lot A better flash for the camera with 9 LEDs in a square and iOS intelligently chooses the pattern based on the subject and its distance from the camera to get the best results possible with this flash The ProMotion display. Its an awesome luxury making everything have a silkysmooth motion. Its a difference you wouldnt notice on other iPhones until you experience ProMotion. I remember reading about ProMotion and almost laughing saying everything moves smoothly enough for me on my iPhone 11. That may still be true but seriously ProMotion is far better. An AlwaysOn Display The Action Button A more ergonomic location of the Side Button. This might not sound like much but if youre like me and you are usually pressing the lower part of the Side Button and if you find you accidentally take screenshots very easily then you will love having the Side Button positioned lower. Its directly across from the Volume Down button. Its not like this on the 15 and 15 Plus There are lots of differences I didnt list I cant make it compare only 2 iPhones just in case youre wondering why it has iPhone 15 Pro Max in there.,1,0,iphone15,16x3drf,8,31,2023-10-02 09:50:34,Top,32,excited

5613,Positive energy for my 15PPM folks,k2dzd9w,chiefarab,I upgraded to an 15PM 256 from an 13PM 128 that was getting full and battery life is at 85. I somewhat feel buyers remorse just because the two phones are very similar. However a 600 upgrade trade in credit from Apple was pretty appealing. Ive been using my phone heavily and it does feel very familiar but I am enjoying the dynamic island action button and how much smoother and quicker it feels. Face ID launching apps autofill and switching between apps feel much better than on the 13. I know some people have issues with battery the phone getting too hot the phone breaking and other issues. My battery feels a lot better than I expected it can last a full day and still have about 30. My 13PM would have to be charged before dinner. Sure the phone gets hot but it cools down after so who cares lol. Titanium is made for this its getting hot because the performance is much better and it needs to be able to handle that power. Phone breaking i always tend to fall asleep holding my phone and wake up with my phone on the floor its happened twice now and there is no marks on the phone at all. Put a case and screen protector on it if youre worried about the phone breaking and boom your issue is fixed. I do still feel a tiny bit of buyers remorse and Im not sending in my trade in until the return window ends. Anyone in a similar situation as me and wants to help each other feel better about getting virtually the same phone,3,0,iphone15,16t86rx,10,6,2023-09-27 04:24:08,Top,9,ambivalent

5632,15 vs 15 Plus dilemma,k2k9fop,Holla_99,After extensive research I went with the plus and I have no regrets. I came from an older smaller iPhone which is comparable in size the the regular 15. 1. No idea how long the regular 15 lasts I know it is longer than my old phone but probably not a huge difference. Depending on use my old phone would barely make it to the end of a day on a good day or not at all on a heavier use day. 2. Ive never had 120hz so I cant really compare there but the bigger screen doesnt make 60hz look any worse than it did on my old phone. If anything it looks even better. 3. Bigger screen and much longer lasting battery is worth the 150 to me personally. 4. The Plus is marginally wider and heavier than my old smaller phone so I dont find it all that big. It is surprisingly light to hold. Its just a fair bit taller. I also have rather small hands and adjusted to the size of the Plus easily within a day or two. 5. I used my old phone without being careful of the battery health and it took over 4 years to drop below 80 at which point I was finally able to get it replaced by Apple without Apple Care. Everyones use is different though. With my 15 Plus I plan on using the new 80 charge limit feature as Im finding even just 80 of a charge can easily get me through the day and only use the included cable to charge. Im unsure if Id be able to do the same with a regular size 15. Anyways the final choice is yours of course but I figured Id share my experience with the 15 Plus. Hopefully this helps.,6,1,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 11:29:18,Top,31,satisfied

5634,15 vs 15 Plus dilemma,k2jolw2,paranoidevil,1. Optimalized charging when is learned it will complete charging at 100 and it pause charging when u charge overnight with same adapter it takes 2 weeks to learn when u use once 5w and then 20w it will not work very well anyway in day it will stop at 80 when u wanna male extra charging. 2. U can live without it if u used 120 and 60 and both was okay u will not notice anything. I used 14 pro with 120hz and now im on 15 with 60hz and nothing special noticed. Screen size doesnt matter. 3. I think here its on u u like more thickness but smaller or thin but bigger device Btw apple magsafe battery pack is around 100 its gently to ur battery it drain from pack and then when empty from phone not charging as other powerbanks so here is difference the 50. 4. If u think about 50 extra spent is much even with apple care u will need pay for repairs but not full price as i read here not my personal experience. Also cant say durability i have mine 6 days but im with case. I think for u will be better just go with case and glass even thin trasparent will help but its my option. 5. I heard about if it drops below 80 before device is year old its on warranty faulty. Im charging wireless with 10w overnight with optimalized charging on and my 13 mini was after year 99 health 11 pro after 18 months 96 same charger. So if u will charge wireless overnight with like 510w its okay better than 20w in day my mothers iphone 13 which was charger like that was 95 after 10months and she use phone less than me. Also cant say if they replace with apple care i cant have my country doesnt support it only resellers and it like 200year. So solution can be for u just buy 15 where u can return i think directly from apple then and if u will be unhappy just return and bring 15 plus I see u care about phone size so it can be solution. Hope this helped. My 15 got 85hours screen on with 25 left saving mode on background app refresh off.,4,2,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 07:11:58,Top,30,ambivalent

I like small phones but when it comes to watching Netflix or YouTube I do not enjoy it as much on this size as I used to on my pixel 2 xl with 6 inch screen. So next Im planning to get a 15 plus for that giant screen with largest battery or most hours of screen on time on an iphone till date. Also now theres an option in battery settings which stops charging past 80 whatsoever. So Id put it on a slow 5w wireless charging pad while going to sleep with the 80 threshold and optimised charging switched on and be worry free.,2,1,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 17:27:08,Top,27,ambivalent
5636,15 vs 15 Plus dilemma,k2kjbjo,Lbenn0707,Ive got the 15. I decided to test the battery life and although for years Ive put my phone on the charger over night the last two nights I didnt. I went to bed with it at 86 night before last I charged twice yesterday for 20ish mins my work commute lol and that was it. Regular usage. I actually listened to xm radio all afternoon yesterday at work and during lunch I watched a show on Amazon prime. When I went to bed last night I was still at 54. What I DID notice is Reddit and possibly Facebook being open even if Im not actively on them seem to cause the battery to drain quicker. I tried to force myself to remember to shut them completely down when I wasnt actively on them. I will say I was busy at work and Im in school at night so I may not have been quite as active on the phone as I could be so that may have been a fluke. Im at 58 right now. After using the phone this morning social media and email check ins lol and having it on the car charger on my way in to work this morning. I cant speak to the size between the two. The plus phones are just too big for me. I prefer the smaller ones. Good luck on your decision,1,0,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 12:51:32,Top,25,ambivalent

5740,Unsolved 15 vs 15 Plus,k58goxo,ZoAbii,Hey OP Im not any help but Im in almost the exact situation Also coming from Android on a larger device with great battery. Ive been considering the Plus or the Pro not the max however my concerns are less about battery as I have access to a charger most of the day but are moreso about the screen size. I think Ill struggle going back to a smaller size screen. Id choose the PM out of all but so much in Australia. It sounds like from what you have posted that the Plus would be more suitable for the battery. Understand your dilemma though,2,1,iphone15,179taga,15,32,2023-10-17 09:01:04,Top,35,ambivalent

Lets face itthat nifty new super zoom 3rd camera on the pro model wont get much use. EDIT I shouldve specified what I meant by same main cameraits a 48MP like the pro models have.

First do you care about the 120 Hz display on the Pro Some people say it makes all the difference to them. Personally I dont really perceive that much difference. If youre someone who would value the 120 Hz display then it might be worth it to you. The second is the camera. The 15 Pro camera is far superior to the 15 camera. If you take mostly snapshots then the 15 has a great camera. If youre into serious photography on your iPhone then you want the Pro. Both will feel large and heavy after your 8 but youll get used to it. Good luck,5,1,iphone15,16s542n,19,65,2023-09-26 01:18:31,Top,71,happy

I am concerned about the early battery endurance tests of the 15 Pro in particular as well. Im waiting to see what some others say as well but for now I am still leaning towards the 15 Pro. Though the 15 Pro having the smallest battery capacity doesnt help. Also in my opinion comparing the 14 to the 15 and their respective Pro models the 15 got quite a jump in upgrades comparatively. Keep in mind that any battery drain hopefully could be resolved by a software update. Likely iOS 17.1.,4,1,iphone15,16s542n,19,65,2023-09-25 23:24:04,Top,70,ambivalent

Is it worth spending more for the pro Depends on the person. You have the answer. As some said the main reason to get the Pro is refresh rate and perhaps camera because dont be fooled someday 3x zoom will likely be needed like on vacation and despite what you read the regular iPhone 15 does not have 2x telephoto it has the 2x button but its digital zoom from the main sensor. Dont forger your new products related to a new phone case screens protector and probably new or more USBC cables for home car work etc. By the way if you break your screen without Apple Care its more expensive 75 USD to replace it on the Pro by Apple and not loosing its features.,2,1,iphone15,16s542n,19,65,2023-09-27 00:17:39,Top,68,ambivalent

5966,Should I buy the iphone 15 plus,k3osgs2,SudoAptPurgeBullshit,You get used to it. I switched from a 120hz android to the base 15 and its not big of a deal. Using ios made me realise how sluggish and unpolished some android flavours are. For me 60Hz on iOS feels close to 90hz on android. And its not like im your average user. I use a 180hz display at home and game a lot on it so Im able to spot the differences pretty well.

5981,15 pro screen scratches too easily,k55orr2,InvaderDJ,Its so hard to quantify something like this. Sand and grit almost invisible to the naked eye can scratch your screen and make you think the screen is more scratch prone than it actually is. There can also be variances between runs one run may have a crappy olephobic coating for example but the week after that could be corrected. The only testing Ive seen of the 15 screens has made it seem like the screens this year are as scratch resistant if not more than previous years. If you get your screen replaced Id definitely recommend a screen protector. Its just not worth worrying about and taking the risk if a scratch free screen is important to you.,2,0,iphone15,179d7s8,20,34,2023-10-16 19:33:17,Top,36,ambivalent

6271,Bought a galaxy s23 but was given an s23 enterprise edition should i returnreplace,kd4dpp2,GJ72,Hardware wise theyre exactly the same. Software wise the enterprise versions are geared more toward business than personal use. Well not necessarily geared toward business just more business capable from the outset. Theyre also more secure. HOWEVER being a mistake if its not actually registered as an enterprise version in the sale you might not get the additional benefits that enterprise editions normally get such as the Knox suite for free for a year and the firmware and security updates for at least four years. For me personally Id contact the place you got it from and ask if having the Enterprise version vs what the actual sale says is going to cause any issues. I dont think it will but itd be better to ask just in case. The worst they can say is Oops we made a mistake.

6351,So happy,kcxqvj7,Prestigious_Factor38,Are you in New York NYC area Ive been looking for someone to pair up with to buy the s23 ultra. At TMobile you can get 800 with a qualifying plan. If you add the 55 your old discount to the qualifying plan the price is reduced to like 75 and then for every additional plan the price is reduced by five more dollars with the lowest being like 65 I think for the Go5G plus plan. Theres also a price reduction for the plant if you are military or a first responder. So 800 off and you get the premium plans for like 65 bucks If you can get three people. 800 off each other phone FYI. Which means you can get an 800 phone for free or an 1100 phone for 300. The way the company makes money on these deals is by forcing you into the high priced plans for like 24 or 36 months. I think the specific one is 24 months. Edit Dont quote me on all the numbers but its something like that. I was checking it out like 2 or 3 weeks ago. But its all still active. If you get the most premium Go5G plan I believe you can get 1000 off the phone. I think the 1000 option is still active too but Im not positive. I know the 800 one is because I checked the other day. Also My mom is 55 so I was going to use her credit to get the 55 plus discount. But she doesnt want to join because she uses a 30 a month plan. Also from the way I understood what I read this can be done for up to four phones. Basically pair up with some people to get the price of the premium plan down to an ideal monthly price and then everyone chooses the phone they want and proceed from there with payments etc. But I dont know anyone unfortunately.

6357,Question about battery and performance,kd1nqsk,Frantik508,Ive had my S23 Plus since September and have never had it feel midrange in any way. Always snappy and great battery but in fairness this is my first Samsung after spending years using Pixel phones. If you want to feel midrange performance use a Pixel 6 7 or 8.

6362,Are there any good 3rd party stylus to use on my s23,kd00ln3,Sf49ers1680,Sadly no. The Note and Ultra phones screens essentially have an extra layer to them that allows the SPen to work. The S23 and 23 lack that which is why the SPen doesnt work on them. There are styluses that you can get for them but they either have a rubber dome or need a battery to operate and they cant replicate the features of the SPen.,4,1,GalaxyS23,18gdf6s,2,2,2023-12-12 04:57:21,Top,7,

Very good outdoor brightness although a bit behind from competition Very good sounding speakers Very good overall camera experience very good overall performance8gen2 is awesome price has dropped a lot so its more affordable now. S pen is nice to haveeven if you never use itsomething unique compared to other phones. Good battery life overall. Good software support so far Samsung Dex is nice to have One of the fiew devices that uses Ultrasonic sensor doesnt overheat Base version should be 12gb ram and not 8European version No charger in the box very high starting price and bad resale value for those that bought day one curved screen and tempered glass compatibility fast charging is behind competition not comfortable to hold one handed or carry for many due to its big size I traded mine for base S23 and while i miss its better battery life and cameraor bigger screen for media consumptioni dont miss the curved screenhated that i couldnt use a tempered glass or the increased weight. I also dont baby sit my phone like with S23Ultra since base S23 is more comfortable to holdcarry. If S24Ultra has a flat screen like rumors say i may be tempted to switch for the better battery and cameras if 8 gen3 is as good as 8 gen2.,6,0,GalaxyS23,18fs5jf,22,65,2023-12-11 14:31:48,Top,71,
6378,S23U users since launch or users for at least 8 months. What do you honestly think about the phone,kcwfel5,stsdota222,Got it since March and it has lagged ONCE The phone is close to perfect but at the same time a bit over hyped. For example I never got more than 6.5 hours SoT and people claim 10 hours or something. Do I care No It gets me through the day every single day sometimes I might have to charge for like 20 minutes if its a crazy long day. About the cameras. I was never into photography and didnt even really care about cameras but man this phone got me hooked. Every nice place I go now I take photos and videos of it . In every chance I take it out to take a selfie with me gf. Photos of my nephew and niece are a bit more difficult on this phone and indoors they are pretty much impossible but it makes up for it with CRAZY DSLR like portraits and crazy good video for an Android. Nothing bad to say about the SD 8 gen 2 this Soc is just awesome it never fails anything even when you try to make it lag it doesnt. The screen is outstanding but its a bit dull if you compare it to previous gens . Screen protectors I have put one in march Whitestone Domand its still on fingerprint works fine never had problems with it . The one thing that still bothers me is that I had to change my lifestyle to carry this phone . In summer Im always on a motorbike and this thing is way too big for any pocket so Im forced to always have a little bag with me . Thats all I thing.

Negatives If the S23 had the same cameras Id probably choose it for size and flat screen. The curved screen was a neat gimmick but it needs to be retired.

6421,Should I get the official charger or use another fast charging brick,kcyq269,pakitos,The thing is that Samsung needs PPS and also the V x A W may be different in your Mi brick compared to the Samsung ones. A Samsung phone may be able to charge at 25W but that is only 9V 2.7A Im just giving an example here but if the charger only does 5V 5A to charge at 25W it wont work nor 12V2A only 9V2.7A You dont need the official one but if its a must to be able to fast charge it will be the easiest way so you dont buy more 3rd part chargers that will not charge as fast.,2,0,GalaxyS23,18g2thc,1,14,2023-12-11 23:29:40,Top,16,

Very Appleesque move. Not to say that the official chargers are quite cheap and bulky tbh. And the skinnyass cable they do still provide is laughable. Stiff skinny and short. So Anker is excellent but a bit pricey. UGREEN products also look pretty decent but i havent tried them. I currently use VOLTME chargers bought on Amazon. Quality is top notch on par with Anker but less expensive. Cable gauge is big and they feel GREAT.

6490,Which offer is best S23 vs S23,kcvi8wr,mikehawk595,Since theyre both essentially the same phone I think the base S23 is the most outstanding considering it ticks all the boxes in a smaller form factor. I strongly suggest revising how you use your phone before choosing. Im a heavy onehanded user and just couldnt get used to the size and heft of the Plus. If you mostly use two hands then the plus is a good option.,3,0,GalaxyS23,18f75xp,5,9,2023-12-11 07:00:45,Top,12,
6491,Which offer is best S23 vs S23,kcu6ys7,akrish_17,I got the s23 about a month ago. I had the option to get any of the 3 in the lineup base plus and ultra and I chose the plus mainly due to its size. The plus offers basically everything I need the ultras corners are rather sharp for me as I use my phone for long periods and the base model has a small display as to what I need also coming from a similar size phone as the plus version so going to the base version would be uncomfortable for the first few weeks. The camera is GREAT on both. The 100 on ultra is great but if youre into photography and videography just get professional cameras as theyll do you better on content. Thats on the feels. Now down to values on the plus compared to base youre getting slightly better thermals due to size both stops at around 40C though but again 23 offers better and youre getting about 2 3 hours of better battery life. The display on the plus is also noticeably better and youd enjoy it more compared to the base version if youre watching something or even gaming. Apart from these there isnt any difference. Both are still beasts and you wont regret your choices with either of them. P.S. if its within your budget definitely pick s23 . Im in love with it haha,2,0,GalaxyS23,18f75xp,5,9,2023-12-11 00:26:23,Top,11,
6492,Which offer is best S23 vs S23,kcwxyw7,Big-Rip2640,Base S23 is the better value and it also has low competition at this price point for its overall package. It doesnt have the best battery life nor the best cameras in the world though. Even its smaller size make it kind of unique in general. S23 has the overall better battery and a bigger screen but at this price point there is some heavy competition in general. In my country for example you can get a 8256 S23Ultra for 900 which obviously makes the S23 at 820 obsolete.,2,0,GalaxyS23,18f75xp,5,9,2023-12-11 15:53:29,Top,11,

I was coming from a phone with the same screen size as the ultra and thought I was going to hate it but it turns out I dont HATE it but i may buy the s24 plus. the battery is fine for me personally it gets through the day sometimes two dsys with one charge. I do miss the bigger screen for videos and gaming. however I have a work phone and often carry them both so I find the smaller size is perfect because my work phone is an iPhone 13 and its the same size as the base s23 so they comfortably fit next to each other in my pocket.,1,0,GalaxyS23,18f75xp,5,9,2023-12-11 05:38:16,Top,10,

6511,Whenever I delete an app and reinstall it it gets downloaded instantly. Is this normal,kcp8svb,redditwithafork,I assume the apk gets cached and if you try to install it again it verifies the checksum to see if it matches the current version on the playstore and it installs from internal cached storage. If it is cached internally I wouldnt worry about it consuming onboard storage since caches like this are usually automatically cleaned up after x amount of time x number of reboots or space becomes limited. This could be part of Googles distributed updates beta that was talked about some time ago where system updates would get downloaded and stored on the device then freely transferred shared to any other android device nearby wirelessly off network via bluetooth for example and this would all happen quietly in the background and users would have no idea its happening. Crowdsourcing system updates as part of an initiative to reduce the energy consumption thats currently required to push down the exact same updates to every single Android device in existence every single time theres a new update.

Its corners are also slightly beefier to protect the glass from the most dangerous drops. Its a great design The screen protector Im using is called Gor and its served me very well in the past months. Its as good as new.

Depending on the email client you use there are different settings to allow your email client to download everything only the last 500 or 1000 messages or only the new ones. And besides that you usually need to wait long enough so all your content is transferred.,1,1,GalaxyS23,18cgz75,2,4,2023-12-07 03:19:48,Top,6,

As for the rest Id wastly prefer getting the 23 Ultra. The impossible solution some S23 model with all those great improvements since 22s but with S22 series image processing O All these gsmarena tests and my shop tests are done with the initial 0123 preinstalled software. The important question any image processing improvements within the 11 or so monthly updates since release Things may have improved drastically as this noise issue has imo nothing to do with lens or sensor all down to this years software choices overall image philosophy from Samsung.,1,0,GalaxyS23,18bns86,4,7,2023-12-06 22:27:04,Top,8,

I never liked the gestures anyways switched to the OG Android buttons which allows me to a. switch apps by double tapping the task view button and b. switch to one handed view by double tapping the home button. You lose a bit of screen estate but it doesnt bother me. YMMV. Tapping on the clock to go to the top of the screen is there a samsung version of this As far as I know there is no native way BUT there are hundreds of apps on the play store that can do this. I cant seem to recall some names though because I dont use it. I cant mute the mic during an outgoing call before the person picks up Im afraid this is not possible on OneUI.

And see if this helps. It should fix it. Also i noticed i never faced any issue recording in hdr10. I just checked my cam with auto fps on video stabilization and it didnt stutter.

7120,How good are Samsung tradein program,kc5abhk,pakitos,I bought a S23 FE using the trade in for my old S20. The S20 sells for like 300 USD in facebook market but thats on the expensive side at least here in Mexico and it got valued at 150 USD at 2 separate pawn shops. Samsung said it was going to give me around 450 USD give or take cause conversion on their website. I sent my phone to a 3rd party company that does the valuations and the payment here in Mexico and a few weeks later its a bit slow they actually gave me the full 450 USD which is a lot more. Of course mine had no scratches had the original screen protector was sent in the original box with the original cable charger earphones transparent case SIM tool and manuals. It only had a faulty charging port but I guess they will replace it along with the battery Im pretty happy with what I got especially after using it for 32 months and after hating the finger screen scanner so much and made me go full wireless for charging at home travel and car. I might do the trade in again once the S24 comes out for either a S23 Plus or a S24 Plus with the S23 FE which basically cost me 0.,1,0,GalaxyS23,18b4e2y,2,10,2023-12-05 21:54:08,Top,11,

7122,ESIM vs regular SIM,kc256d9,pakitos,Im not sure how it is over there and how Verizon works but if you fully bought the phone you should be able to unblock it. If its part of a monthly plan then I dont think you can use the eSIM without unlocking unless you can manage to talk it out and tell them its going to be used just for international travel but I doubt it since there is no partial way and also any possibility of them knowing if you really went abroad or not. The SIM to eSIM is just a transfer on the Verizon side if they support the eSIM. So you just need to visit a Verizon store or maybe you can do it over their website if they have a client tool for that. do typical International services all support the use of eSIMs these days and should I therefore simply keep the eSIM available for future use That depends where you are going. Some countries might have just SIM and some will have SIM and eSIM. Here in Mexico the eSIM is getting pretty popular but in the cheap MVNO cause you get the eSIM with some data for really cheap and then you port the number to another company for benefits and then repeat once the benefits end in company 1. However the biggest company in the country Telcel will only hand you an eSIM if you get a monthly plan. ATT sometimes allows you to get one but that depends of the store and the guys that work in that particular store. One thing to notice. I dont remember having the eSIM option like that when I had a locked phone so chances are big that your phone is unlocked if Im not mistaken.,3,0,GalaxyS23,18b3wz8,2,7,2023-12-05 05:06:57,Top,10,
7123,ESIM vs regular SIM,kc38cma,Scoobygottheboot,If you intend to go abroad I would keep the esim available. Whenever I travel I get a data eSim through the app Airalo. It works really well.

7124,ESIM vs regular SIM,kc22ksx,TacoOfGod,What youre trying to do would be possible. Going the eSIM route would pull all of the required info off of the physical SIM and then kill it once its done.

On top of that I also used my S10 for a tradein discount .. So it was dirt cheap compared to what it normally costs. My old phone was in perfect condition and had 0 scratches even after 5 years of use. But the battery life was slowly getting worse I wouldnt get the security updates in the future with the 5 years support limit. Since I live in the EU my S10 came with the Exynos chip. But this has never really been an issue for me. The phone has served me well for nearly 5 years and Its been used a lot I will say tho that there is night and day between the battery life of the S10 and the S23 .. Even from new the S10 wouldnt be able to hold up. But you have to take a few things into consideration as well. Screen resolution is not the same which is very easy to spot on the S23. So obviously the S10 would require a bit more power to run a higher resolution. Im over all happy with the S23 and I really hope the battery will keep performing like this for another 45 years. I thought about waiting for the S24 but I dont need my phone to have AI or anything like that. It needs to have a good battery life decent camera and a quick cpu like the snapdragon.,3,1,GalaxyS23,18ack57,28,138,2023-12-04 11:58:38,Top,142,

I thought the difference was over exagerated but it really isnt. That being said I dont know anything about the new Exynos chip and maybe its even better than the Snapdragon this time around. But Im sure I want to see solid prove of it being just as good before buying an Exynos phone again.

There is no issue with it and even if the snapdragon lasted me 12 hours more which is good its still not that bad.,-6,2,GalaxyS23,18ack57,28,138,2023-12-04 05:13:06,Top,134,

If you look at my list history Ive posted about this too. You can see its normal because it only happens on stack or list task changer. I dont know why they changed this but its hella annoying. Your phone is not defective trust me. But ya why they changed this is beyond me. They also changed tapping empty space to go to home screen. Now if you were on an app and tap empty space from task changer it takes you to the most recent app instead. EDIT I just use gestures though no nav bar. EDIT 2 A way too see it is go to vertical list and you can tap and grab before the animation is done.,3,0,GalaxyS23,18a6bi4,12,36,2023-12-04 04:25:27,Top,39,

Next a workoaround to your problem would be to simply double tap the recent button itll achieve the same thing you wanna do without the touch delay.,2,0,GalaxyS23,18a6bi4,12,36,2023-12-04 23:59:28,Top,38,

The first press doesnt register because the app hasnt loaded fully onto the recents screen. I have also observed this in social media apps settings page while scrolling. The first press stops the animation instead of taking you directly into what you clicked. The second press is the one that works.

I dont think its a phone problem or a speed problem its a design choice the touch event simply isnt registering to select the app from the task switcher until the animation finishes. All the people suggesting you clean cache does this ever even do anything Most useless advice... or turn onoff features misunderstood your problem its not with phone performance its with how the task switcher works. My only advice is to use the doubletap on the task switcher gesture to quickly switch between two most recent apps. Thats always super fast and no need to wait on any animation to finish. Or switch to the gesture navigation and use the swipe gesture.,1,1,GalaxyS23,18a6bi4,12,36,2023-12-04 15:42:20,Top,38,

The main camera is problematic just like s22 ik because my friend has one and it has some focusing issues and blur around the photo. Just put this into your mind when you are going to make your decision. For me it is not a big issue because the photos are still great if you dont focus too too much when i try to photo a document i will just use 3x zoom because of the blur issue. Other than this battery performance display speakers and software is just perfect. If there is anything extra you want to know about phone just say me and i can send screenshotsexplain. For s24 there is not much going on other than they could be using exynos and they have an ai chip inside as i know.,-2,1,GalaxyS23,18a0wmw,3,11,2023-12-03 20:28:49,Top,10,

It wont be as good as hardware based but you can improve it by recording the fingerprints in the way you use finger to unlock your device. Like I mostly use upper part of thumb but then while recording fp I was doing the whole thumbmostly middle.

7565,Galaxy S23 base coming from iPhone 13 and Pixels,kbi5pe4,GeneralChaz9,I would still be using a Pixel 7 if I didnt have so many hardware related issues. Loved the size main rear camera and the OS experience of it. But that modem was not good for me with dropped calls and dropping signal it would overheat a ton when using the camera for anything longer than a minute the phone would constantly disconnect from wired chargers and by the end it would drop to 2030 by 2pm with minimal usage and a full charge at 8am. Needless to say my S23 has been a reliable device on the hardware end with a solid UX with OneUI. Its not my favorite take on Android but it has customizability and good software support to back up the rest of the phone. And all of those things that went wrong with my Pixel 7 are not issues on this device. The wife has better luck with Pixels and is currently using the new Pixel 8 without any issues so maybe its just me Lol Glad youre liking the device.

This has significantly increased the quality of my low light pics and helped with the motion blur that I was getting in pics.

7691,Charging from 25 to 85,kbb3j1x,MaxOfS2D,Yes to some degree. I want to bring a bit of nuance to this though. The manufacturer has leeway on where they want to define 0 and 100. From what I gather and take what Im saying with a grain of salt its more of a question of voltage. They could decide to make the battery stop charging once its internal state reaches 4.1 volts which reduces the chemistry degradation a lot but theyd be leaving some capacity on the table. So they could decide to go higher up to to 4.15 maybe even 4.2 which is where things can start getting dangerous. I dont have any data to prove it but I have a very strong suspicion that cheaper devices and even some mid to high end laptops do this to squeeze out more advertised battery life. They eagerly cut into the longterm lifespan to provide a slightly longer charge in the first couple hundred uses. But yeah. Avoid heat when charging always Slower charge is most likely beneficial it does avoid heat too 20 to 80 is a great rule of thumb,6,2,GalaxyS23,186xyyf,17,46,2023-11-29 20:14:47,Top,54,
7692,Charging from 25 to 85,kbb0e30,NefariousnessJaded87,The only real facts you can find on LiPo batteries Google the manufacturers are these Do not deplete below 20 Do not heat up when using or charging Everything else is someones opinion. May be right or not. So in your scenario charging from 10 would be worse than multiple charging from 2585. Charging daily from 25 to 85 does not hurt the battery but you limit your capacity. Charging to 100 and disconnecting the charger once the battery is full is better than charging overnight and leaving it on the charger. Trickle charging is worse than not charging. So there are no real guidelines except the two I presented to you. Rest I up to you.Tip You can make routines to control your battery state ie. charge to 85 stop then once a week maybe charge to 100. My advice use it as you see fit just avoid depleting it below 20 if you want to keep it healthy for a long time. Option Changing the battery after a couple of years is but a 10minute job at a service centre...FYI.,4,3,GalaxyS23,186xyyf,17,46,2023-11-29 19:55:49,Top,53,

7694,Charging from 25 to 85,kbcf8lj,theboogedyman,Look at it like this. If youre only charging from 25 85 then youre not allowing yourself to take advantage of 40 of the battery capacity. Youd be better off not to worry about it because after 3 years or so of normal charging your battery will only be degraded about 20 max. The only scenario that there is any benefit to this whatsoever is if you plan to use your phone for 4 or 5 years. Then perhaps there might be a slight benefit,2,1,GalaxyS23,186xyyf,17,46,2023-11-30 01:28:29,Top,49,

7696,Charging from 25 to 85,kbmdb4x,Ok-Brick-8406,the scientific explanation is that the extremes of charge levels like 0 at negative and 100 at full positive wear out the lithium ions which in reality move from one side of the battery to the next and electictrity pushes it to the positive side. keeping it where it doesnt have to be extreme is less damaging such as its better for you as a person to sleep regularly rather than stay up for 4 days and then be non functioning for a week. the recommended is around 3080 2585 is acceptable also for battery protect. but galaxymaxhz helps you mod many things,1,0,GalaxyS23,186xyyf,17,46,2023-12-02 00:23:56,Top,47,
7697,Charging from 25 to 85,kbnjcno,unecare,Yes its true. It will extend your battery health. But.. why do we need to extend battery health Not to lose a battery discharge skills. So called battery would last longer in near future. But to do this are we gonna sacrifice the current battery life I mean we are denying using the battery at full capacity to gain a little time from the acceleration of losing the battery capacity. In my opinion its not worth it. I prefer to use it at full capacity at 100 so I charge it to full. I dont see a reason to not to charge it to full 100. Just make sure do not allow battery to go down under 30 percent. Its dangerous for battery. It will lose its health very quick.,1,0,GalaxyS23,186xyyf,17,46,2023-12-02 06:18:35,Top,47,
7698,Charging from 25 to 85,kbdwngz,cromagnonized,Charging to 100 is harmful to the battery. However the degree of harm can be neglected depending on some factors previously stated here. I will add just one thing Keeping the battery around 100 for a long time is actually more harmful. So if you leave your phone to charge at night at least set up a routine that stops the battery from charging at 85 and just 1520 minutes before your normal wakeup time stop the routine so the battery will be charged up to 100 when you wake up.,0,0,GalaxyS23,186xyyf,17,46,2023-11-30 10:07:04,Top,46,

Ill go to their personal facebook sometimes Ill even google them to see if they have arrests and stuff lol. Can never be to sure especially if youre going to meet a stranger with a handful of cash. But like another commenter said sometimes people genuinely just dont want the phone anymore..especially if they switched to iPhone. Some people simply prefer a different OS. So it could be genuine.

Ainda não chegou mas vi horas e horas de comparativos entre iPhones e Androids inclusive trabalho em uma loja que vende iPhones e poderia pegar um com preço de revendedora ainda assim optei pelo Android. Você tem que considerar o sistema e se ele te agrada... De uma forma geral o iPhone tem um bom sistema mas com limitadas formas de personalização pois a Apple se considera capaz de dizer exatamente oq você quer e pronto. E para a maioria das pessoas ela pode até estar certa... No meu caso não. Com relação a hardware as câmeras do s23 estão superiores do que a do 1415 é superior em vários aspectos com a ressalva que em 60fps 4k que você não pode mudar entre as lentes que estão gravando depois de iniciar a gravação. Mas no iPhone você tbm não pode pausar mudar para a selfie voltar e etc no Android você pode. No Samsung você também pode alterar todas as configurações da câmera ISO Exposure White balance e etc. iPhone te dá 0.5x 1x e 3x se não me engano e se quiser mudar algo é depois que a foto já foi tirada na edição novamente mostrando que a Apple acha que sabe oq você quer melhor do que você.

I dont really care about the differences they offer in terms of software tbh I look at hardware. Because everything is getting updated day after day surely getting better for both ends. If youre into gaming then S23 but if you think iPhone suits you better then so be it. I personally think iPhones are for people who are very simple yet productive since they always have better cpus so maybe if theyre a content creator an iPhone really does the job better. Ironically a friend of mine F told me Id get btches if I got an iPhone so I was just sitting wondering why an inferior iPhone 12 pro user was shit talking my S23 so get an iPhone if you want girls ig I game on mobile rn so nothing beats S23 more specifically Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.

Personalization isnt as good but there are many more options nowadays on IOS. IOS fluidity will always be better than android since it is actually made for the specific device. Design is subjective size is about the same. Battery life will be better long term on the iphone considering the OS and radios do not drain as much battery on standby. Edit there are also qc issues with the samsung like banana gate. Also if you are trading in an iPhone you will probably be able to get the iphone 15 for cheaper or around the same price as the s23 depending on if you are buying it up front.,1,0,GalaxyS23,185o26d,23,103,2023-11-28 21:09:17,Top,104,

The S23 also has native telephoto 3x lense. The iPhone takes good photos per usual but when you compare 50mp with 12 its night and day. Ive always advised against the iPhone 14 it has no noticible upgraded over the 13. Either get the iPhone 13 or the iPhone 15 if you really want an iPhone it also has the new 48mp sensor that is a bang for your buck alongside the dynamic island.

Im fairly confident Samsung does make it less fluid and ever so slightly more clunky to use if you install a 3rd party launcher tho so just be weary of that if you plan on going deep into the customization rabbit hole on the galaxy side Design wise either of the phones are gonna be perfectly fine some people dont like the sharp corners on the ultra but that didnt bother me and its a nonissue on the other 2 S23s the iPhone 15 Pro lineup however has some incredibly thin bezels if thats your thing Consistent updates wise Samsung says theyre doing 4 years for flagships and afaik Apple is still supporting all the way back to the iPhone XR with iOS 17 so either way you go it should last you a while if you want it to Im on a 15 Pro currently and it really boiled down to the fact I live in the US and iMessageFaceTime are the default rather than just about everywhere else where WhatsApp and friends are the go to the fact I liked the way the pictures look straight out of camera more and being a raver and wanting to take the absolute best videos I can while at events and being able to send my videos to friends with relative ease Im also just particularly fond of iOS I thought I missed Android and I ended up just missing iOS after switching If you have any other questions just feel free to ask Ill try to lay it all out for you as best I can I still have both phones as well if youre wondering about something specific,1,0,GalaxyS23,185o26d,23,103,2023-12-02 07:27:42,Top,104,

I do like many things on iOS but android just has so much more freedom I cant live without one. Even when I had iphone for a few years I had an old Samsung on the side. Im glad I got away though and now only have to carry around one device. Theres so many reasons why I love and prefer android I cant even type them all. I do feel you on the apple watch tho. Its definitely the best smart watch series on the market imo. I tried an apple watch and galaxy watch from the same year apple watch SE 1 and Galaxy watch 3 where technically Samsung should have the better straw due to the apple one being their budget watch yet the apple watch was SO much better than the galaxy watch. Galaxy watch was nearly unusable. In their defence galaxy watches became better from 4 onward as they switched OS but still. I do miss apple watch.

The only downsides Importing ringtones way back then was a pain.

And my recent Google TV experience added to it I had to go Apple TV route to sidestep it. So I dont know. I guess it depends right Ill give it few more years and check again. But then Im an iOS engineer and I prefer to stay up to date with everything. So this makes the switch even less possible.

If you care about image quality theres no good reason to use gcam or default camera just shoot raw and edit in lr cause its too big of a difference. Expert RAW shots are better if edited properly but PRO RAW require less editing overall. For video dont use gcam use the camera app record in 8k 30 fps PRO MODE.

8011,Upgrade from Pixel 6 to S23 or Pixel 8,kb09wld,TheManDownTheHall,Im considering the same move. I have a pixel 6 pro and Im thinking of waiting for that s24 in January. My issue with a pixel is the lack of connectivity. That modem disconnects way too often and I have to reboot the darn thing. I dont care how good the pictures are its a cell phone first and if I have to keep rebooting because I get that stupid exclamation point in my signal gauge its not much good to me. Ive heard the pixel 8 still has that issue and Ive also heard that it doesnt. Ive also heard the pictures on the Galaxy have issues like the shutter lag.

8013,Upgrade from Pixel 6 to S23 or Pixel 8,kb158kj,ElectricSnowBunny,The camera assistant app in goodlock will allow you to pretty much eliminate shutter lag. I did it as soon as I got the phone and have never had a problem. As far as the oversaturation you can turn off hdr and the other postprocessing stuff in camera assistant as well. Or you can just shoot in RAW. I dont have a problem with 126gb but I also dont keep a lot of photos and vids and stuff.,3,0,GalaxyS23,1859qge,6,8,2023-11-27 21:53:17,Top,11,
8014,Upgrade from Pixel 6 to S23 or Pixel 8,kb0qwcb,jake0456,For me personally I switched from the Pixel line. I had a 5amotherboard failure and 7overheating weaker signal worse battery life. Cameras arent important to me though so I cant comment much on that. Obviously the Pixel 8 will be better as I do know Samsung usually oversaturates a bit but you can install a gcam port at least for that. What I do love about the S23in my case is that I can rip out as much of OneUI as I want and Pixelfy it a bit. Goodlock is also awesome and allows for further customization. My S23 has never overheated like the current Pixels do. Battery life signal performance are just better overall. Samsung may be known for bloat and more bloat with their software but their hardware is excellent Also Im suspicious of the bumps that are being reported on the Pixel 8 display. Its clearly components of the phone being pushed against the OLED and while Google says its no big deal....it very well might be and they should probably extend the warranty for it.,2,1,GalaxyS23,1859qge,6,8,2023-11-27 20:26:14,Top,11,
8015,Upgrade from Pixel 6 to S23 or Pixel 8,kb47ntf,lxblutxl,I like the camera from s23 more but thats because I shoot mainly RAW and edit in Lightroom so the problem with oversaturation does not apply to me. It takes some time to produce good pictures but I dont mind spending 12 minutes extra to have a really good photo to post online. S23 has raw on all lenses main one 50 mp. For video s23 again ahead because of that 8k 30 video in PRO MODE. I have a 4k display and can easily spot the difference between pixel and samsung videos. The 4k from pixelalso from samsung are overshaprened but the 8k from SAmsung is barely sharpened. And because it is recorded in pro mode the colors are more natural. Default 8k has washed out colors dont recommend that one.,1,1,GalaxyS23,1859qge,6,8,2023-11-28 14:03:19,Top,10,

8047,Samsung s23 plus or ultra,kb28nko,lightpsycho,S23 ultra new buyer here. Had Samsung flagshipsNotes since the Galaxy S3. Switched to Note 3 afterwards and bought a new phone every 2 years up to the Note 10. The S23 Ultra is noticeably heavier than the Note 10 and is a bit larger too. I guess your choice depends on your needs and field of work. Personally Ive been an S pen addict since my first Note 3 so naturally I went with the Ultra. For anybody wearing skinny jeans you can forget about putting that one in your pockets If it wasnt enough already I put it in an OtterBox Defender case along with a Whitestone Dome glass protector. The whole package currently weights in at 312 grams about 34 pound I barely use my phone as a phone I read watch videos and use Messenger. Meaning I need the biggest screen possible as I do not want to buy a tablet. It is the perfect device for this. I wear cargo pants daily so I could care less about the size or heft. All that being said I do hate curved screens. Makes me buy 59 CAN screen protectors. And I plainly never understood why they actually make them curved. If I simply wanted a hiend phone and didnt care about the pen nor did I care about having the biggest possible screen maybe Id get the Plus. Then again if I were to game on it which I will probably never do I have a console for this Id still want the biggest possible screen.,0,0,GalaxyS23,184ym3x,10,31,2023-11-28 02:14:00,Top,31,

8075,Seeking Recommendations for Galaxy S23 Screen Protector.,kb5iss2,SkillYourself,I had two S23s to work with and bought amFilm and Spigen kits to try out. They both come with an alignment kit so the feature are at parity. amFilm and Spigen are both 0.33mm glass and work with the fingerprint reader. I didnt even have to reregister any fingers and the taptowakeunlock still works. The important part is making sure the fingerprint reader section is clean of all debris and dust by shining a bright flashlight at the screen during install. I personally preferred the amFilm kit because its half the price of the Spigen kit and came with a big dust removal sticker but it has a selfie cam cutout while the Spigen kit covers the whole screen. The Ushaped cutout can be distracting but on the other hand it prevents finger smudges from interfering with the camera.

8085,Is the regular S23 worth it,kaviyr3,jjscap,I used different flagship phones over year incl Xiaomi and Iphone. Samsung S23 is easily the closest thing to the perfect phone. Incredibly responsive unit.. good choice for those who dont have any time to waste.. Unless the app is particularly poorly coded or whatnot everything runs lightning fast and smooth. Mad props to Qualcomm for developing such a powerful and efficient chipset in SM8550. One should not consider S23 FE which is equipped with an inferior chipset S23 is able to hear me from long distances. So when I cant find the phone in a place Ill simply say Hey Google and itll respond from a far corner that I can hardly hear. Id also not get up to fetch it for certain tasks but instead would just hey google it from where I stand and it responds incredibly quickly. This kind of use of a phone is still surprising if not shocking to people around me. My daily screen time average is around 80 mins. I recharge it every three days. 120 Hz enabled Elated with the photo quality. Not too much experience with videos but I was not happy with a video I shot in dim light.

8088,Is the regular S23 worth it,kawle5j,KubaCeTe,Honestly I think its the most reliable phone on the market. There are better phones in some aspects but as a full package there is nothing else. No overheating best battery stable performance. If you look anywhere else there are issues. iPhones 14 have terrible battery 15 overheats. Xiaomi has thermal issues. Pixels have a rebranded Exynos chips inside so its nowhere stable as S23. Also the 6.1 inch screen without sacrificing battery feels so so great. The price is also very low now. The only complaint I could have is OneUI which doesnt seem as polished and refined as competition.

The multiple shots also rocks so unlike my friends burst on her iPhone.,1,0,GalaxyS23,184fum7,52,139,2023-11-27 01:08:18,Top,140,

Maximum temperature i could reach was 41.7 degrees celsius using emulators. Usually stays around 30 to 35 degrees under normal use.

8216,Galaxy s23 vs Iphone 13 pro max,katnwhb,Plokimon,Reasons for S23 you might not need all of these but just listing whatever is coming off the top of my head Usb Type C faster charging better support less chargerscables to carry better accessory support which would be usable in other devices as well and not just one phone cheaper cables ability to use HDMI faster data transfer Can reverse powershare I have charged many iPhones for friends who need to charge their phones and are unable to find a lightning cable. If I forget the charger for my earphones or watch i can charge using my phone. It also works while the phone is charging. Being able to cast wirelessly to most screens miracastchromecast and not just airplay compatible useful also in hotel rooms. Also able to play something on the wireless screen while playing using the phone for something else Heavily customizable can use simply like an iPhone and everything would work but you have an option to tweak all the little things to make things better for your liking especially using GoodLock by samsung e.g I have customized the navigation gestures to do 90 of the things on my phone without having to readjust my grip and reaching far with my thumb You can also set different buttons to do different things as per your wish Much more capable file manager Can stream to multiple bluetooth devices at once have used this to watch movies on the go with friends without having to share earphonesheadphones works across brands even airpods can adjust volumes and everything for each device can even play different things on each device Even outside of bluetooth can play multiple audio at once e.g when you are scrolling instagram with music playing it wont stop the music again and again whenever something with audio comes up Splitscreen Multi window Ability to use multiple apps at once or pinning things on top easily. E.g i have used this a lot of times to bring up calculator while looking at some data on the screen or to copy things from one app to another manually when copy paste is not possible and many more things Good compatibility with IOT smart devices none of the IOT devices I have support Apple Home but they support Google Home or SmartThings which can be easily controlled just by pulling down the notification shade. Easier to transfer files between devices between other androids and windows extremely easy and fast using nearby share for any other random device if its a small files you can atleast share using bluetooth without having to upload it somewhere and share That reminds me of linksharing. You can just share large files using links also .. it will be uploaded to cloud and the other person can download and the link can deactivate on its own based on the time set. Better screen recording from what I know when you record screen on iphones it shows the control panel at the end which is just weird Better audio codes supported for bluetooth devices Google assistant and bixby are better than Siri afaik Can also an entire desktop mode wired or wirelessly. Dex Depending on your country 1. Samsung PayGoogle Pay might have better support 2. Repairs might be cheaper,3,2,GalaxyS23,1844rvk,6,28,2023-11-26 11:36:01,Top,33,

This feature cannot be disabled. However has no direct connection with Notifications. The feature itself manages services and features being run in the background. But does not clean or affect apps with regard to notifications. If you have an active app open with notification this would clear any notification you would receive yes. As it closes down the app and since the app was open notifications would not be presented to you. Head over to Settings Apps Select the app Battery Unrestricted to prevent this.

And if I forget to charge it it will turn off because battery reach 0 this happen many times already since 30 of November 2023 after Oneui6 up to now 26 November 2023 this never happen since May 2023 up to now with ONEUI 5.1. This is huge downgrade about battery life. Furthermore when I play heavy game the temperature is hotter random lag and stuttering and it reload the game after 30 sec when I just switch to Facebook to check something then back. YouTube stuck at 120hz when watching in full screen it not down to 30hz or 60hz depend on video fps as it was on Oneui5. Random stuttering and lag reboot the phone then it will be good again for few hours oneui5.1 I only reboot my phone after firmware update on Oneui6 I have to reboot around 45 times daily. I regret to update to Oneui6 it makes my S23 Ultra from Ultimate 1500usd phone turn to 100usd Chinese garbage phone. Yeah they control the software so they can make best phone become worst phone. Next phone I will join Apple got enough from this terrible experience since Note 5 up to now more than decade with Samsung and Android time to say goodbye S24 Ultra will face the same thing after 1 year when S25 Ultra come out my S22 Ultra now is a damn garbage phone and my S23 Ultra 1tb also is garbage phone after Oneui6.

8482,S23 vs S23 Question about Battery Life before buying,kaibl21,TavorX,I was also battery conscious when choosing between the S23 line ups. Ultimately got the S23. I concluded that the S23 Ultra even with the largest battery isnt really significant considering the more premium and demanding screen size resolution. The base S23 has the smallest battery capacity while obviously the S23 has the bigger battery. Even with the bigger screen its not pushing high screen resolution or high ppi. Actually the Plus has the least amount of ppi 425 for base 393 for the Plus and 500 for the ultra. So to me it looks like all the factors put into the Plus makes it a battery stand out without too many compromises. Have been using this Plus since October and super happy with it. Ive yet to kill it in a single day. Came from the S10e and absolutely hated the battery on that thing but loved everything else about it. Now its like I have the premium Samsung experience with the right amount of battery life to pair with it finally,9,1,GalaxyS23,182bnkj,9,25,2023-11-24 00:51:17,Top,35,

8494,S23 vs S23 Question about Battery Life before buying,kalhp24,ElectricSnowBunny,Battery rocks on both. Honestly I just think it comes down to what size you prefer. Storage is also a thing if you cant get the 256gb s23 base its not a problem for me but I also dont take a billion pictures or run large games. I have the base because Im in love with the size. Its just so comfortable and easy to handle. I had forgotten how much I love using phones this size after years of prioritizing the largest screen size I could get. I only charge to 85 and get a day and a half easy and then a quick hour charge back to 85. You will be happy with either but if you want to save the money the base isnt a consolidation prize its a fantastic phone as well.,1,1,GalaxyS23,182bnkj,9,25,2023-11-24 18:48:41,Top,27,

Ive also noticed that the autofocus sometimes struggles to focus on closer objects. If you just open the camera app point and shoot theres a chance that the photo gets bad.

However this is not the only gate these phones suffer from. In the bundle with your new faulty Galaxy you are also getting the Pengate the S pen sometimes just does not work. Granted some might argue that you need to take it out of the phone first but if I am paying this much for a phone I just dont want to be bothered. Another issue that plagues the new Galaxy series is the Powergate the phone just randomly shuts off Rude customer service employees told me I needed to charge it or something but again its a 1300 phone for Gods sake Finally there is the infamous Moongate you better sit down for this one. Basically when you zoom into the Moon the phone will use AI to enhance the details of the image something unheard of in the smartphone world. Again the customer service employees rudely dismissed this issue on the grounds that you can just turn some Scene Optimizer off but I want my refund So in conclusion stay away from the faulty Galaxy phones and go for an iPhone instead a device with zero bugs and issues.,-2,3,GalaxyS23,12s6dc3,0,33,2023-04-20 07:04:24,Top,34,

8608,Why do people pay 1100 for a Iphone 14 Pro,k0q6ghj,Shaky_elm,I left an iPhone 12 mini to move to Android. First tried the pixel 7 pro which was a very negative experience no native music player for music files on phone photo quality was way below advertised couldnt connect to Bluetooth devicescar and ended up switching after a few days to the at the time very new S23. Much better experience over the pixel 7. However its no iPhone pro competitor. My partner has a 13 pro so weve done some comparisons. First off the big one for us photo quality. iPhone pro is basically professional quality S23 is good but doesnt compare. As part of partners job involves photography and videography the iPhone gets the win for raw quality and adjustability native photo editing. Screen as an everyday user they are both very good high quality and durable. Unless you look at a spec sheet any regular person wont notice a difference. Weve both dropped them on some hard surfaces before we got them into some sturdy cases with screen protectors. User interface this one is personal preference but honestly the iPhone is much easier to navigate find things in settings and adjust quality of life things such as gestures S23 is very very limited there Battery I think my S23 technically has a better battery I barely use mine and drain about 4060 per day. While my partner is a very very heavy user as it doubles as a work phone and gets through about 7080 of total battery life per day. So realistically Id be tempted to give iPhone the win on this one but either way youll get a full day from them. Overall the S23 is a great phone has some really good features. But it doesnt stand up to the iPhone pros. Sincerely a S23 owner. P.s. I am by no means an apple fan but when any company makes a solid product it deserves some recognition. Or if they make a crap product they should be called on it.,4,0,GalaxyS23,16jd5v1,0,59,2023-09-15 17:46:41,Top,63,

Best to take a photo of something with a lot of details like a page of text or a flat surface with pattern and texture brick wall or wooden wall. Then you can check if you have blur region surrounded by sharp region. As other mentioned your 3rd photo has some other issue besides banana gate issue. The entire photo is blurry. So that is either focus issue or camera shake. Do you test outside or in good light. Remove any possibly slow shutter speed issue.

For me its also interesting that people believed that People are you blind At first I thought my previous phone S20FE didnt have that issue. It had it but it was not so prominent so I never really noticed it. S23 blur is crazy And I think that blur is always there on some photos you can spot it easily like scans etc on other photos you cant see it without paying attention but blur is there decreasing your image quality Software updates I doubt they can release global software fix which will address all those flawed units.

8644,NOT waterproof help,k9o2gh8,randompartner,Sorry OP you are correct to say that a splash of water shouldnt damage the S23 and that its IP68 but the phone is subject to multiple things that can affect overall resistance. For starters you mentioned its a second hand phone do you know if it once had the screenbacketc replaced Because for sure this will remove any water resistance. And as others said micro cracks on the screen can be enough to get water in. Additionally just the steam of the shower can be enough to damage your phone so even if you dont let water touch it things can still go wrong in the long run. Lastly Samsung doesnt cover any water damage and thats the first signal you should take to use the water resistance as an emergency thing eg dropped it in the sink or something and not as oh Ill take a shower because its IP68.

Its best to think of IP68 as a safety mechanism if you were to accidently drop it into a body of water for a few minutes.

The summary was she thought the S23 had a better lens setup than the 6a but the 6a had better post processing although she had issues with that as well. She said all these later phones take pretty good pictures but that all had their flaws. Her advice to me on the blurred text and close up photos in general was move the phone back a little bit for the best pics. She also had a bunch of other tips for getting great pictures with the S23 that have changed how I take pics. Although I frequently get pictures from the S23 that are incredible I still think for general purpose use among nonphotographers the Pixels take better pictures. Fortunately Im not a photographer because the S23 is better in every other way. I can live with slightly worse pics.,1,2,GalaxyS23,12orcku,0,68,2023-04-17 14:44:04,Top,71,

8742,Should I ask for a replacement,joq5aod,None,In my opinion this isnt banana gate since I believe you only experience this in close up shots like taking a picture of a piece of paper. This isnt the cameras fault. The main lens is simply not designed to click close up shots like the one you tried to click. But if you try to click the same picture using the 3x lens youll see that the picture comes out perfect. Thats because the 3x lens is designed to take close up shots. So the problem isnt the main camera the problem is most people using the wrong lens to click close up shots and then confusing it as banana gate. If your phone had banana gate issue youd see that the blur appears in ALL the pictures you click using the main camera not just close up shots. TLDR Your phone is fine.

Plus factor of funny marketing from Samsung side better prices than on preorders in Czechia Ultra was now on the price of the regular S23 amateur assistants at the official stores. But I have to say I never had a problem with my phones. Phone watch gratis and bonus for promo code sharing and much more what makes value of the phones down.

I tried the Samsung DAC USB to 2.5mm adapter with Sennheiser HD 599 headphones.

8765,Bananagate check at Samsung Experience Store,jhvuypk,jbraft,Your ring of blur was most likely typical bokeh effect and those units with the ring blur didnt have the banana blur issue. Not surprising considering you were basically taking macro shots of labels from a 45 inches away on a phone that doesnt have a macro lens. There are several opinions on how to properly test for this issue and most arent so close up as it sounds like you were doing. Also that close to a subject and its easy for the focus plane to be off. Someone did a poll here a couple of weeks ago and last I saw out of 170 responses it was 21 with the issue 79 without the issue. Ive tested my S23 in various ways and have only seen the bokeh effect when I was taking a picture of a small square instruction booklet from 45 inches away but moving out to 12 inches with a legal sheet full of text my unit had no blur areas. Most test with text but I also tested with a fine weaved blanket I have but no banana or other blur testing from 12 to 36 inches away. I tested with several text scanning apps and the text extracting function of the camera with no issues fortunately. Still I guess 21 is a big enough number. One reason the Ultra might look fine is the the S23U has a AF function in the UW lens and it automatically changes from the Wide to the UW lens in near distance thats why it looks different between the S23 Ultra and S23S23.,-1,2,GalaxyS23,13079at,2,27,2023-04-27 05:13:58,Top,28,

8805,PSA To everyone who think that S23s have focus issues with the main camera Banana gate and its a factory defect you are wrong,jsawuv0,exclaimprofitable,Again it kinda is a defect. Not a sensor one but a lens one. There is just no way to make a optically good lens out of plastic and that thin so compromises were made. If it is purely a large sensor thing not a lens defect then tell me how fullframe and medium format cameras with infinitely bigger sensor than the S23 can take a completely fine picture of a flat sheet of paper zero blur but the s23 produces a circular blur on the photo It is because the plane of focus on the S23 is not really a flat plane like on professional lenses but instead it is kinda spherical you can find that defect on some real lenses too. Samsung could have added a variable aperture or made the phone thicker to include better optics. For what they can do now they could focus stack the photos when it detects that you are trying to take a photo of a flat sheet of paper would take slightly longer to capture the image but it would fix it completely. Or they could do selective sharpening that takes into account the focus distance and the pattern of the blur at different distances also would work.,3,1,GalaxyS23,151e45u,1,21,2023-07-17 10:29:03,Top,25,

You have better selfie camera and Raw on all lenses and 50mp raw on main lens which is incredibly important if you are into photography.

Also the lack of responses is probably because 1 its kind of old news now and 2 people tend not to say much when there arent issues.,1,1,GalaxyS23,11r3o53,0,25,2023-03-14 15:52:03,Top,27,

Ive taken photos of several documents and sure there is some blurryness on the edges. However the blur is not bad to the point where the documents are unreadable. They are actually easy for me to read even with the blur. And also in case people havent realized your phone camera is not a document scanner. Samsung didnt put a camera on your phone with the main purpose of taking document pictures. Document pictures is an after thought who cares if they arent perfect.

8960,the main camera is unusable. In Germany the community is raging,jbirnkx,jbraft,Tested out my US Verizon S23 512GB as you suggested based on the linked article and couldnt reproduce the issue. I took pictures with and without flash of two documents that were dense text an old document I created and printed one mailed financial document instruction page. I matched up any aberrations I spotted in the images to the paper documents be it caused by a crease in the page or the cheap printing from the financial institution. No obvious areas of blurred text banana shaped or other. Im not saying the issue doesnt exist. The linked article concludes with the following A software problem on the other hand seems unlikely especially since not all Galaxy S23 or Galaxy S23 users are affected and of course it cannot be completely ruled out. The article speculates there could be a quality control problem. With S23s being assembled in at least three countries and probably parts manufactured in several others its possible there could be an issue that could affect some units and not others.

People saying you should buy separate camera or saying that people are not buying this phone for its camera are completely delusional. That is the 1st thing what is mentioned of this phone everywhere. Even in Samsungs own marketing. Of course you should be able to be critical of that. This is the very expensive device and you should expect better from it. Completely understandable that OP is disappointed in this performance and sad that he cant return the device.

9017,S23 Base256 GB SoT,k3oqiov,hope89f,Why is the subreddit so full of posts like this When will you realize that SOT depends on WHAT you do with the screen on WhatsApp has drained your battery in almost 2 hours of screenon time while YouTube or any basic video playback would have drained it in almost 3 hours. Some apps drains much more battery every certain number of minutes with the screen on compared to others so SOT is always subjective. You can achieve 78 hours only if you do a lot of video playback or simple web browsing. Furthermore the 78 hours youre talking about are valid for a total screenon time of less than 1620 hours whereas in your screenshot its evident that the phone has been on for more than 24 hours in total.,3,1,GalaxyS23,170zzuj,1,12,2023-10-06 06:59:44,Top,16,

9019,S23 Base256 GB SoT,k3p4mkb,More_Chicken_9367,The biggest improvement when it comes to battery for S23 is probably from software optimisation. So because of this the idle drain is very minimal and excellent. So as mentioned in one of the earlier posts. SOT is highly varying and depends on the app you use. You could get 7 hours SOT with a possibility total 100 to 0 drain happening in about 10 hrs. The more you fiddle with your phone the faster the battery depletes irrespective of SOT bacause there are other things happening in the background behind the screen as well. So in short this seems pretty good. Just put your phone on charge whenever possible without fully charging or fully depleting it as much as possible.,1,1,GalaxyS23,170zzuj,1,12,2023-10-06 10:19:06,Top,14,

But I can see why other people would dislike it.

9110,camera sucks not ultra,jbef6m0,BigStroms,Hello I recently switched from an iPhone X to the S23 and I wasnt really impressed by the camera quality. However people are sharing photos like crazy. I have a very simple complaint its impossible to take a clear photo up close such as capturing text on a computer screen because the S23 focuses on the center and blurs out everything else. Apparently this is a feature of the lens which is ridiculous. I havent seen anything like this on any other device. Its 2023 and youre buying a flagship device from Samsung yet you cant take a clear photo of an A4 paper or a computer screen without it being blurry.,1,2,GalaxyS23,11lncne,0,31,2023-03-08 13:35:51,Top,34,
9111,camera sucks not ultra,jbhiyfo,Forward-Ad-826,I disagree the photos Ive taken upgrading from a s21 and flip 4 is better. One thing I will say is that if you generally do not know how to take good pictures sometimes the result from the phone mag not be desired. Its not a simple aim and shoot phone all the time but its good 90 of the time in my case. I do think future software updates will definitely improve this dont give up hope just yet. Its a new product that takes great photos. Just need a few tweaks. How is your experience outside of this,1,1,GalaxyS23,11lncne,0,31,2023-03-09 02:06:45,Top,33,
9112,camera sucks not ultra,jfjkmfg,arniej1978,Indoors on my S23U if I dont use night mode when Im taking photos of my dogs sleeping or anything like that the photos come out slightly blurry not sharp and the colors are a little bit off. Forget about the ultrawide or zoom lenses those are grainy and terrible indoors. I also have a Pixel 7 Pro. If Im going to be taking outdoor photos of landscapes I take the S23U as the zoom is useful. The camera quality is about the same outdoors on the Pixel 7 Pro but I like having the zoom and more camera features on the S23U. For videos I also prefer the S23U as the video quality is better. For moving shots like at the park with my dogs I always take the P7 Pro because the S23U generally sucks with moving subjects. For anything indoors I also use the Pixel because the camera processing is far better indoors. The P7 Pro has the better camera but the S23U has the better features.

9224,Why is S23s camera so incredibly bad regarding noise in low light images,jha03n8,kssmith1972,The s23 retained the details while the others applied more aggressive noise reduction. As a photographer for the last 30 years Id take the s23 shot every time. You cant undo all the noise processing the other two apply but I can spend two minutes in Lightroom and adjust the level of noise to my liking with the s23.

9226,Why is S23s camera so incredibly bad regarding noise in low light images,jhbejea,SeniorRojo,The Xiaomi is definitely the best. However the A50 is objectively worse. It has the least detail due to aggressive noise reduction and its dimmer. The S23 is brighter in low light conditions but Im this situation it sacrifices exposure for noise. However in my practice the S23 usually applies way too much noise reduction in low light and exposes for too long just to get a bad shot. This phone does not excel in low light.

9227,Why is S23s camera so incredibly bad regarding noise in low light images,jh9uhex,cdegallo,Im not sure what was going on in wherever those shots came from but the overall lighting is different which changes the relative exposure used by the camerasee that the S23 shot has blue sky in the window whereas the A50 the window is dark. So the camera is likely to choose a longer exposure time which would allow for better noise characteristics rather than a shot with more light would choose a shorter exposure time and result in more noise like the S23 shot.,3,1,GalaxyS23,12v7cfk,4,46,2023-04-22 14:29:31,Top,50,

You will get a mirrorless camera or DSLR s23 looks better of the two right now. Because the detail on the carpet is not lost. Detail before the grain is important in photography. Because of those who want such smooth photos Samsung has been processing photos like an oil painting effect for years. Dont expect completely grainfree photos at high ISOs from tiny sensors anymore. This is completely impossible. It is impossible even with a 1 sensor. It can be corrected to a certain extent with artificial intelligence. But if you do too much details elsewhere will be lost this time. x200B There is also a photo softening setting in the camera assistant program. It does extra noise reduction.

Next you ate using the darn phone. If you use the phone THAT much then why arent you plugging in the phone at work in your car at home using a PowerBank Im a heavy user. But my phone sits on the charger at work its plugged in the car etc. I also bought a battery case which adds an additional 10k mAh on top of your 4750mAh. That will give you 15k mAh or 3 TIMES the battery life. I leave the country many times a week to get dinner and a few beers then head back as Im 10min drive from MX. I sometimes dont get back until 3am4am after being there for 12hrs chatting with friends and all. Well I used to carry a power bank in my pocket. Now I just use the case amd never had a dead battery.

I disabled Always On Display because Ive never used it and Ill conserve more battery. The last Media volume is Bluetooth set that to whatever you want but in my case Ill probably move it to 100 because my phone automatically pairs with my car and I control the volume from the stereo not the phone.

9269,Is this a okay,jduauz1,MurkleGiraffe,Depends entirely how you use your phone if thats a day out on mobile data in bright sunlight then its not too bad if its a day inside on wifi could probably be better. If you account for your remaining battery 20 and the protect battery 15 youve still got 35 unused which would get you up to 6 hours SOT and 21 hours total. Its also worth noting that the S23 over charges at 100 so i reckon the 85100 is actually worth like 20 rather than 15. That said play services looks high you can find plenty of posts on here about reducing it clear app install optimisation and clearing cache. If you used smart switch I would recommend a clean install as Ive found it makes a difference. The other thing is youve had your phone a day likely youve been battering in with installs and updates and it hasnt had a chance to learn your usage patterns.

Samsung has better camera software support accessories UI customization slimmer larger display while same proportions significantly higher peak brightness armoured aluminium frame faster usb port and higher procesor clock speed. Only thing ZenFone is better at is selfie cam resolution 10 paperly higher battery and jack. Selfie res doesnt mean its better jack can be added though 5 cable and Samsung battery management is next level cause its impossible for me to kill it within one day averaging around 8 hours while having everything on. I wouldnt even consider ZenFone cause there is no reason to unless youre brand fan. Edit Im not Samsung enthusiast. S23 is my first Samsung device.

9278,Please convince me I made the right choice,k1wzqdu,PrimalPuzzleRing,This is just going by paper specs S23 display is much brighter its also one of Samsungs best display. Dynamic AMOLED 2X adaptive 120Hz vs. Super AMOLED 120MHz144Hz game S23 has telephoto camera lens. S23 uses USBC 3.2 vs. USBC 2.0 x200B Z10 has 3.5mm jack. Z10 has band 7 for WiFi Z10 has side mount fingerprint reader vs. On screen Z10 has larger 4300 mAh battery vs. 3900 mAh x200B So really these are the only thing that stands out. So if any of those pertain to you. Now for the nitty gritty. OS Updates S3 13 14 15 16 17 5 years security updates Z10 13 14 15 4 years security updates So youll get longer support from Samsung. Not sure how ASUS does their phone warranty but you get 1 year with Samsung and they fix it for free. x200B If you want more battery life on the S23 just set it to Light Profile. On my S23U I can get about 8 hours SOT non gaming while using WiFi and have 15 left. So if any of the listed above makes you lean towards more on one than the other then thats entirely up to you.

9287,Please convince me I made the right choice,k20n4m5,nightshadeky,Honestly the fact that the Zenphone has a headphone jack is not a good thing. You may only see a 3.5mm port from the outside but the full size of the headphone jack component is pretty massive relative to the size of the phone itself. So the question is what did they leave out in order to free up that much internal volume They had to cut corners somewhere in order to make that much internal real estate available. There is a reason why only larger form factor electronics still have a headphone jack. There just isnt enough room in a modern phone to fit the jack without leaving something else out and whatever they left out is far more valuable spec wise than the headphone jack. The inclusion of a headphone jack in phones is a manufacturers way of cheaping out on the build in such a way as to convince you that the cheaper component is somehow more valuable to your long term use of the phone. Stick with the higher spec phone and buy a DAC if wired audio is that important to you. A DAC will have higher quality audio than a 3.5mm headphone jack anyway.,2,0,GalaxyS23,16qfik7,0,37,2023-09-24 17:20:41,Top,39,

9330,its shocking how close the gap between smartphones and apsc cameras have become,jg34df8,None,If you want subscribers for your YouTube channel you might try pitching that to people and coming up with real content. As it stands this is just yet another Im YouTube expert who is not really an expert posts. Simply put it is embarrasing and conveys either ignorance of the two devices or an intent to misrepresent them. Yes I am a photographer and have long since lost patience with this crap. 1 The A6400 is a 3 year old camera with industry trailing IQ for stills paired with a very basic bargainbundle lens. As for the camera it was never more than average with stills IQ that could not match cameras literally produced half a decade earlier. Vloggers seemed to like it which makes sense given its size above average video for its time and idiot level controls. 2 The A6400 is such an advanced camera that it can be gotten new with lens for around the price of a S23 Ultra. Yes that is sarcasm. That speaks to entry level old device. BTW body only is less and price with a lens depends upon your bundle. If anyone is in the market dont buy it. Again it was average at best for its time and is not worth even its discounted price today. 3 The photos posted demonstrate either intent to push the phone or a singular lack of skills with an ILC device. I will leave others to decide which actually applies. 4 Both cameras in your hand could do better than your test shots as could just about any nonbargain bin phone since at least 2017 or 2018. That however does mean any phone is a match for any DSLR or ILC device. It means crappy point and shoot images look like crappy point and shoot images when you compare a point and shoot camera to a DSLR or ILC being used like a point and shoot camera. 5 You obviously have no clue what it means to have a larger sensor with larger photosites look up light capture shadow recovery highlight clipping etc. etc.. The same applies to variable aperture ILC lenses although you did pick an idiot level ILC that makes it difficult to change shutter speed and aperture so perhaps you dont fully grasp the point of real camera features in the first place. A good photographer can take a quality image with any camera you put in their hands. Unfortunately the reverse is also always true. A bad photographer or one trying to make a point can take bad images with a Nikon Z9 or Hasselblad X1D. What you have demonstrated is that crappy shots look equally crappy on a point and shoot and entry level ILC. It says next to nothing about either device and everything about either your skill level or intent.,17,0,GalaxyS23,12kjday,0,1,2023-04-13 12:38:57,Top,18,

Use Samsungs internet browser. its much better. 2. uninstall facebook and all its crap. Its spyware that hides its battery usage. And FB loves to track which apps you use which sites you look at how long you open each page etc. 3. Dont have twitter running in the background. Similar to 2. Getting 1000 notifications in 5 hours means your phone is running twitter in the background constantly to get those notifications. 4. Tiktok in the background drains battery too... 5. make sure your connection is set to LTE only no 5G. If you enable 5G your battery life will automatically be about 40 shorter. Thats coz 5G sux. 6. That said 5 hours of web browsing in bright sunlight will drain the battery much faster as the phone is boosted to max brightness. My 5 hour SOT playing Genshin Impact takes only about 60 to 70 of battery life so Im pretty sure the phone battery is solid.

LED bulb will cycle at much higher frequency and it is not stable and will fluctuate. So LED bulb can be unpredictable. So the rule of thumb is to set fps to 30 or 60 Hz for USA. And the shutter speed should be 2x of the fps so 160 sec or 125sec. The 2x rule is to prevent motion blur.,6,0,GalaxyS23,12v9sg2,0,9,2023-04-22 18:27:43,Top,15,

9475,My experience switching from iPhone 13 to Galaxy S23,k2o80yv,GGmyBOYS,So a thing that I dont agree with is the smoothness between switching the apps. So if u scroll apple and samsung side by side at 120hz apple will be slower. So the catch here is that apple has slowed down Annimations to make u think its smoother whereas its just slower. If u increase the animations time on the Samsung expect no less. Second thing transferring from Samsung to Samsung is fluent like it is apple to apple. Its more like an apple problem that they choose to keep their ecosystem more restricted bcoz Samsung can fluently transfer to other android devices as well by Nearby Share and other such services. Third I think it shouldve been pretty obvious for the wallet which one u would be better off using or should be using which is obviously having Samsung in its name but u can use the other one as well. There are no restrictions to either Fourth I dont think a learning curve is a con or the features that are provided. If u think its a con I would rather suggest switching back over to IOS with hardly any features and opportunities to customize anything at all. Overall I think these are more of personal problems that u are facing. If u dont want to learn or use features or u dont know what to do its more of a you problem rather than the cons of a device. Also if ur family is with apple its ur personal problem as well. My family is much more understanding and I ask them to use Google Meet or Whatsapp which give a rather good quality video which is far away from blurry. Also u obviously will get some perks when u use a device with a single company manufactured component and apps because they are tailored specifically for the device whereas apps that u use on Samsung are used by every type of android device ranging from Xiaomi to Motorola,16,1,GalaxyS23,16uw989,19,53,2023-09-29 02:53:48,Top,70,
9476,My experience switching from iPhone 13 to Galaxy S23,k2od4j4,Macguyver76,Theres a lot youre doing wrong here and its not your fault its just a learning curve. You cant be on iOS for years and expect to figure everything out on Samsung right away and Samsung Android is very different from Pixel Android. A few of your gripes are handled natively on the pixel like voicemail Google wallet and password manager. However Samsung has the best hardware on Android but Samsung has more of a kitchen sink approach to software. Therere a ton of options and once you have things set how you like them its a good experience it will take time. Ive been on Samsung and pixel for years so to me the settings menus are very intuitive and I know them well. When I have to find something on iOS on my wifes phone or one of the kids devices I find it an absolute mess and it pisses me off lol. Heres some tips off the top of my head. If you dont have a Gmail account get one and sign into it on the phone if you have one sign into it. Log into chrome on it and make sure the password manager is setup. Then search auto fill in the phone settings and set the Google password manager to default and then go to Google in the settings and make sure its syncing. Uninstall or disable the Samsung one. Download and setup Google wallet turn on NFC and use tap to pay. It works everywhere apple pay does and its never accidentally triggered for me. The voicemail situation kinda sucks but it is what it is it works like an iPhone on the pixel but never as on Samsung and other carriers. There are some decent third party apps. I personally disabled or uninstalled a lot of the Samsung apps. I use the Google calendar messages keep Gboard wallet etc. Its generally a better experience. As for the degraded pics and video well thats apple keeping a stranglehold on their lock in strategy and intentionally degrading pics and video to get people to think other platforms are inferior when we have all the same features and more but they dont want the iPhone user base to know that. Sending via RCS from Android to Android phone works like iMessage no degradation and its encrypted. Anyway I could go on but I hope that helps.,9,0,GalaxyS23,16uw989,19,53,2023-09-29 03:32:41,Top,62,

9478,My experience switching from iPhone 13 to Galaxy S23,k2pqx5q,MrPilgrim,Appreciate your post. I think some of your challenges may be country specific perceptions. Im presuming you are in the USA. For instance Everyone else has iPhone Apple Pay. Seems more secure widespread intuitive and works Here in UKEU these dont hold true. Everyone uses WhatsApp. G Pay is the same as Apple Pay which is the same as using a debit or creidt card to the retailer in that its contactless. G Pay is seamless if its fast enough to get you through a tube turnstile at rush hour that means its fast NFT Doesnt seem secure at all. Ive turned off the NFT feature so that I dont accidentally walk by and pay for something I dont want. Ignoring the phone needs to be on etc this is a common misunderstandingurban legend from decades ago. Contactless and chip pin have been around for ages. Your comment is the equivalent of saying eveyone with a debit or credit card all here have contactlessNFC needs to put them in a shieled wallet or Faraday cage in case of accidentaly paying for something. Also the whole bad person with a scanner is a myth they need a bank account to process it etc.,8,0,GalaxyS23,16uw989,19,53,2023-09-29 12:33:32,Top,61,

The whole iMessage green bubble controversy doesnt make any sense where I live Brazil since most of the people use Whatsapp and SMS is only used for advertising and 2FA. Its likely that if I ask a random iPhone user here about iMessage he or she might not even know what Im talking about. About Apple Pay being better than Google or Samsung Wallet its down to banks supporting them. Wherever contactless cards NFC are accepted any of them will work.

Its a known issue with the ultrasonic fp scanner samsung uses as compared to the optical one used on other androids. The solution is to use a stack of coins and place them over the fp scanner while curing the uv glue to squeeze out any excess glue over the fp scanner area under the tempered glass. Do it and the fp scanner will work fine.,2,0,GalaxyS23,16uw989,19,53,2023-09-29 07:46:24,Top,55,

9490,My experience switching from iPhone 13 to Galaxy S23,k2rmx5v,Zytose,As others have mentioned it does just seem like a learning curve. I suppose in short iphone is an easy to use get the job done device that anyone can learn to use in an evening. Android will allow further personalisation and functionality but youll keep finding features you didnt know existed. If it makes you feel any better regarding gwallet Which I use you cant acually use it unless your phone meets googles safety and security standards. Out the box these standards are met but if the software is tampered with i.e modified OS then the wallet will be disabled. Users like myself on the s23 One UI6 beta will know this very well because even though its samsung provided google disables the wallet until full release. Regarding the video problem typically if one enters full screen it is implied that you want to watch it horizontally otherwise why are you bothering just watch it as is. I cant say ive had the problem of changing rotation. only thing I can think of is you have it locked and accidently pressing the rotation button. I dont bother with the samsung password thing most apps keep me signed in so I have no use for it. regarding bank details I never store them. Its a personal choice though. The fingerprint sensor is a problem I had run into myself admittedly I think it was because of some screen protectors I bought previously so I tried another brand and these ones seem to work better and dont give me any problems getting in now. Only advice on this is try to get tempered glass and from a reputible brand if possible. If your life with iphone was more convinient before and your not wanting to learn a more complicated system then it might be worth sticking with what you know and works for you.,2,0,GalaxyS23,16uw989,19,53,2023-09-29 19:41:53,Top,55,

That sets it apart from Google Drive. The other person doesnt need Dropbox to open the link. Well they probably should get it if you want them to share clear pictures and videos with you. I partially agree with your casefingerprint issue with the androids. BUT you really just need a thin case that protects the backside and edges of your phone. You dont need a fancy case that completely enclosed it rendering the fingerprint useless. I found one screen protector that actually works with fingerprint 90 of the time. I can share info if you need it. As for the password generator I would just download 1password because its amazing and top notch. It has password generator fingerprint unlock a security key to encrypt your entire account AND a bonus feature which I LOVE is their 2 factor authentication feature that is built in the app. You can copy it from an extension in your browser and log in super fast. This is why I will be a customer for life. Youre missing a big pro APKs emulators. Theres an emulator for every system if you can find it in the app store and you can sideload any app you want for free if the PlayStore wont let you download it due to older android version.,2,0,GalaxyS23,16uw989,19,53,2023-09-29 20:54:58,Top,55,

Annoying also is the rounded display if you want to scroll through videos.... gosh Also Playstore and all the pay walled apps sucks hard. I switched from a Iphone 12 pro max due to a damage I caused to the S23U and I currently waiting to get an iphone again. Performance wise the S23U is nice also the camera is quite good but the camera sucks if you want to do pictures within social media. Next issue I experienced is the really bad voice quality. This was mindblowing to me. Iphone was always crystal clear while talking but the S23 sounds like pure shit. Im also disappointed by the battery.

9513,S23 All the issues I encountered in 13 days of ownership.,jifg18z,r_slash_jarmedia,honestly a lot of these issues are just things that are going to be different when compared to any iPhone. the vibration motor is a tough one because since Apple started using the Taptic Engine in the iPhone 7 series no phone on the market has come close to the iPhone in terms of haptics. missing a lot of notifications isnt unusual on these phones because Sammy has switched to a differentaxis motor in recent generations which makes touch haptics feel better but makes it harder to notice vibrations when your phone is on a surface or in your pocket. the notifications just behave different on Android in general they dont wake the screen but I believe some 3rd party apps allow you to do that or you can use edge lighting to see a popup of the app though that wont be the same as waking your whole lockscreen. the heavy processing of pictures can be avoided by changing settings playing around with camera modes disabling scene optimizer etc. as for the cameras bananagate unfortunately thats a hardware problem that you cant do much about though the focus issues arent really issues theyre the downsides of a bigger primary sensor. a lot of those focus issues would be resolved if you just move your phone further away from your subject when trying to snap a photo. hope this helps out in some way,7,0,GalaxyS23,134m40y,4,21,2023-05-01 13:28:00,Top,28,

Two years ago I got Samsung S20 FE for work phone. And I have being using both Samsung and iPhone Xs Max concurrently. First 13 days is difficult to make assessment on iOS vs Android. It takes a longer to get used to the new OS and then being able to make unbiased assessment. On the issues that you have. If it doesnt work then return it while you still have time. Everyone has their own preferences. In general Apple iOS is just more polished. So it works for like 90 of people. But if it doesnt work with the remaining 10 there is nothing user can do about it. On other hand Android has a lot of customization so everyone can probably find the setting that works for them. But some of the things you mentioned are HW or firmware related so not user modifyable. Weak vibration I agree. Also issue on my S20 FE. I have to turn on ring tone when Im outside so I dont miss calls. Notification system S23 has AOD always on display. If you turn that on I believe that should address the notification when screen is off issue. Does detailed notification work together with AOD I dont know. Something to test out. Camera processing There is a lot of competition on Android side. Companies are trying to stand out with their phone. That means both features and post processing. On the other side Apple just take the middle of the road approach on processing and features. Then other factor is personal preference sharpness brightness white balance. For example Pixel 7 tend to sharpen whereas S23 tend to soften. Alternative is to try Pro Mode and also Expert Raw. Pro Mode give you more control. Expert RAW should address the overprocessing issue but then you need to work with RAW file.,2,1,GalaxyS23,134m40y,4,21,2023-05-01 16:35:17,Top,24,

Nothing phone may be a good fit for you but its not exactly small a new one is coming soon.

However once people started testing it quickly became apparent that as I said this might have been the biggest ultra upgrade ever.

9670,Where is update to s23,jx4caii,catalinus,Something was really fckedup with the August update in EU ILO CSC which was almost always same with EUX just sometimes delayed a few days was released about one week ago but so far nothing for EUX. At this point the only explanations that make some remote sense are that there is something that for instance breaks privacy laws in EU in the AWGJ code and we should see a higher build that fixes it EUX might directly go to the build that has some 5.1.1 features and that was released by Verizon apparently even if in some places that is reported as AWGH which is prior to AWGJ.,7,0,GalaxyS23,15x5ctn,1,6,2023-08-21 11:57:01,Top,13,

Mine doesnt along with thousand others. Some have it but barely noticeable. While some are in the extremes especially true for earlier units made. The issue definitely exists and the reports are a real concern. But it doesnt immediately apply to all S23 units. Its just unfortunate that it tainted the otherwise amazing specs of the phone.,5,1,GalaxyS23,157cghc,2,10,2023-07-23 11:42:18,Top,16,
9677,Already decided to get S23 8256 but found out about banana gate. Does it affect normal photos or text only,jt5dx5d,jmydy,Let me explain a bit. This topic is very often misunderstood and a lot of people are repeating the same damn thing depth of field. Depth of field might be mentioned when talking about those pictures where one subject is in focus and background subjects in distance are out of focus. This is depth of field in short there are more details about this to fully explain the topic like aperture etc but lets skip those details. In my opinion problem with S23S23 is caused by defective lens or its installation. In S23S23 some areas of picture are always slightly out of focus 1. Depending on what were photographing it might be minor issue or big issue. With closeup photos its rather big issue because its way easier to notice blurry areas than on landscape photos lets say. On my unit closeup photos look just bad you dont really have to try hard you just see that picture is blurry focus point is super sharp but the rest of the photo is very blurry... 1 And how I now that some areas are always out of focus Have a look at my other comment here,2,1,GalaxyS23,157cghc,2,10,2023-07-23 18:10:55,Top,13,

I also use 120 hz adaptive with the Max hz app which lowers my screen to 10 hz when no actions are done. And speaking of battery life I get on average over 9 hours SOT daily.

It also makes the devices feel much bulkier. The Ultra is even worse Id rather not mention that. Whenever I hold my previous S21 FE it amuses me just how much comfortable it is to hold despite being almost the same size. And for people saying just buy a cover covers will follow the shapes and contours of your phone. So if your phone has an uncomfortable design the cover will be uncomfortable as well.,-1,1,GalaxyS23,17ya9lt,0,46,2023-11-18 18:12:01,Top,46,

The same goes for your printed paper test. If you actually want to test bananagate take a photo outside with the subject really far from you for example take a photo of a cityscape. If the corners are blurred in a photo where everything should be in focus due to hyperfocal distance then you have the bananagate.,2,0,GalaxyS23,13nvhti,4,72,2023-05-24 12:47:37,Top,74,

It then periodically checks the voltage of the cell and if it drops below a certain level it starts charging back up to 100 again. Whats happening is that the OS shows you that youre at 100 or 85 but since the circuit had cut off voltage to the battery its actually already drained a bit.,1,0,GalaxyS23,156w2y7,0,3,2023-07-24 05:06:22,Top,4,

9857,New case,jcyn2km,manhducdm,2 years ago I got myself a rinoshield case for my galaxy S10 after keeping the official silicone case for a year. I quite liked the silicone case but it really isnt that durable it was pretty beaten up from just getting in and out of my pocket. When I switched to the rinoshield one the first thing I noticed was the bulkiness of it. It wasnt a bad thing but keep in mind it is nowhere near as sleek as the silicone one. But I have to say its build like a tank. It can withstand any day to day threat and still looks good as new after 2 years. I think its worth it considering you wont need to change case beside the maybe time to time relooking. Also the designs are gorgeous so go for it. For the moment I got myself a leather case for me S23U and Im quite pleased with it. Im thinking to get a rinoshield case during some sales but no hurry. PS You could scout the internet for some promo code. French speaking youtubers quite often get sponsored. But I have to say these days there is a lot of competition in the case maket so its more difficult to find one.,3,1,GalaxyS23,11wlhh4,1,2,2023-03-20 15:49:32,Top,6,

By the way if youre looking for a good screen protector Samsungs own ones are good Im using one and if youre heavy handed with the S Pen it will leave very light marks in the protector but theyre selfhealing to a degree and disappear over time. I especially liked the Lshaped bracket that sticks to the bottom of the phone and helps you to align the protector before sticking down.

I was considering the same thing a few days ago but then i did some calculation When I bought s22 256gb for 70k i got it planning use it for 4yrs that becomes 17k per year. Assuming if I upgrade to s23 Id use it for same 4yrs but now Im paying that 37k to extend my use by just 1 year20k extra that what i should. This disparity becomes greater if you plan to use it for just 3 yrs which honestly seems like a more realistic lifespan Now if 20k is worth it to you for a 1.5x battery performance then by all means you should.

Good lock modules not fully working home up for example but no issues for me as I do not havely rely on the good lock modules . Icons got a bit bigger but not that much. I use samsung dex a lot and this workes as intended after update . All in one phone seems snappier than before after the update . Also if you plan to wait till 6.1 I guess youll skip security patches and for me security is in prime position . I always have all my devices on auto update if those wouldnt be important you wouldnt had that option in the settings. All brands recommend updating to latest os as they patch repair fix stabilize enhance device functions I am a mare user so if the producer wich is the brain behind your device tells you that is recommended to update why not doing so I mean they are the masterminds behind your hardware that they sold it to you when Im only the one that enjoys what I have paid for.

The older rounded style required a stronger grip for me to keep it it in place while square corners stick out just enough that I dont need to do that.

All the graphics transparency and other effects use graphics and some might struggle with it. Its like if u play Genshin on S23 it will fly through but u will struggle with it on lower and mid range devices. So they have to tweak some things up here and there before they release it Also since Apples all phones are just mainstream highend devices they just push out software updates altogether and they do slow down the phones that may have problem running those interface.

9995,Shutter Lag Banan Blur questions,jwqqef1,cdegallo,1. Its shutter speed if youre worried about subject motion blur in shots. Shutter lag is the gap in time between when you press the shutter button and when the frame is captured. For shutter lag Samsung improved this and also has tweaks that you can use in the Camera Assistant module that furtherreduces shutter lag at the potential cost of photo quality personally I have not noticed any reduction in quality. I havent had issues with shutter lag and snapping the shot I expect at the time I expect. Shutter speed and subject motion blur hasnt really gotten a meaningful change as far as my S23 ultra goesbut I will say that having used an S21 ultra most recently it is better. I also used a pixel 7 pro recently and have a spastic sonIll be honest at this point I dont really run into any differences between them and subject motion blur. I used to be a huge stickler about subject motion blur but I have no qualms with my S23 ultra in that regard. 2. I also have an S23 and have not had the banana pattern blur on either the S23 or ultra. AFAIK Samsung hasnt acknowledged this specific issue only a general focus issue which was in the August update release notes.,1,1,GalaxyS23,15ul0b8,0,9,2023-08-18 16:44:04,Top,11,

Check out my post with my camera comparison of the banana issue. Allegedly its slightly fixed in the august update but I dont have it yet in my region so I cant compare. Apparently not every S23 has this issue and also not everyone seems to care as much so youll get a lot of different and contradicting opinions. Best thing you can do is judge for yourself by any material you can see and also maybe try the phone for yourself if thats an option.,1,0,GalaxyS23,15ul0b8,0,9,2023-08-19 09:44:32,Top,10,

This is also my personal experience because my S23 is defective and the vast majority of S23s I have tried in stores had this defect so if you take pictures of text often you should probably avoid S23s or hope to find a nondefective S23 but you are more likely to find a defective one.,1,0,GalaxyS23,13tezxv,1,28,2023-05-28 07:24:30,Top,29,

I use a popsocket and place it slightly lower than the middle of the back of the phone. I rest the popsocket between my index and middle finger. Extremely comfortable and this is the setup Ive used for years Ive owned mainly Note series phones the past decade and needed to figure out the best way to hold it as Im a heavy user and my hands and fingers are ridiculously short. I was never a fan of the popsocket aesthetically but Ive tried pretty much every phone grip in existence and its honestly the most comfortable for me.

But the fingerprint sensor is lightning fast with compatible screen protectors perfect without a protector. I dont know if either OS is better but I prefer One UI for its customizability.

10081,Anyone switched from iphone 14 pro returned finally,jbk4eiu,uecker87,I switched from a 14 Pro to a S23. I tend to switch between Android and iOS every year or two. I enjoy the fluidity of iOS but get bored of it pretty quickly. I am a software dev and I like to tinker and customize it. Face unlock on the S23 series wont be as good as FaceID because it is just using the front facing camera and doesnt have IR sensors etc. I found that it works pretty good if I hold it at a stable distance away during both the setup of face unlock and when trying to unlock with it. The first week or so I was probably at 5060 success rate with it but now Id say Im around 9095 so good enough for me The fingerprint sensor on the S23 series is really good IMO. MUCH better than the Pixel 7 series. If you want a really simple and clean interface try other launchers. I am currently using Niagara launcher and while I cant customize it as much as I want I have to admit it is really fluid and simple to use once you take a few days to get used to it. Normally after a couple weeks Im constantly picking up the iPhone and toying with going back to it. I have absolutely no desire to switch back to my 14 Pro in the near future this time around.,1,0,GalaxyS23,11ll6eu,0,7,2023-03-09 16:55:23,Top,8,

10083,Base S23 text photos taken at different distances,jh5ppcx,D00M98,Actually it is not so bad your examples. 20mm is quite noticeable. 30cm and above is still there but need to zoom in and look for it. Good news it that it is symmetric instead of off axis. The ring is more of a problem because in real life photography there are subjects in this area. The real proof is if you can observe or notice the softness in that ring in real life photography. In the other examples posted only the blur is observable even in landscape photography where subject and focus is far away. To me that is not acceptable. Im not concerned with corners because even professional camera lens that cost 1200 are also softer at corner.

Just open camera point it towards the screen tap to focus on it and then there will be a small sign on the bottom right.

10152,Comparison BananaGate April Update vs June Update,jp6a3ax,None,In my opinion this isnt banana gate since I believe you only experience this in close up shots like taking a picture of a piece of paper. This isnt the cameras fault. The main lens is simply not designed to click close up shots like the one you tried to click. But if you try to click the same picture using the 3x lens youll see that the picture comes out perfect. Thats because the 3x lens is designed to take close up shots.So the problem isnt the main camera the problem is most people using the wrong lens to click close up shots and then confusing it as banana gate. If your phone had banana gate issue youd see that the blur appears in ALL the pictures you click using the main camera not just close up shots. Also if your phone had banana gate the blurred text would be practically unreadable. So something to consider is does ALL your pictures have a blur around that area TLDR Your phone is fine.

I was worried that Samsungs bloatware would prevent me from getting the android experience i wanted but honestly its way better than it was. I installed Googles app to replace Samsungs tweaked a couple of things and now Im like at 90 of my previous Pixel experience. Samsung has some wins too with its OS like multitasking windowed apps and notifications. I think the way Samsungs manage notifications is superior to Googles offering. Love getting the small drop that turns into a slim line that I can choose to click on to see more or let it go away on its own. On the hardware side the S23 is the best phone Ive ever used. Thermal management is impressive sound and haptics are great screen is amazing camera looks great but Im not a heavy user so dont take my word for it. Form factor is the main reason why I got it in the first place great size Plus 5 years update is really nice to have on Android Apple is truly king in that department,3,2,GalaxyS23,15w36i1,3,79,2023-08-20 15:55:04,Top,84,

I also used to use Nova but the experience of navigating this os is so smooth and in intuitive that I never installed it on my s23.

Also great photos usually Asus phones are some of the best in blind tests. For me it was just a bit too small. With S23 you can quite easily bypass the Samsung apps and bloatware in OneUI and what cant be isnt annoying anyway in my opinion. Its not like the first OneUIs anymore. Also if you keep your phone for long then you get updates more years. But then why not Pixel 7 or incoming Pixel 8 Slightly bigger but really not big either and you get the real full Android vanilla experience.,1,1,GalaxyS23,15w36i1,3,79,2023-08-20 07:01:15,Top,81,

You can also run a custom launcher if you dont like One UI. I have a S23 Ultra but I use mostly Google apps and Nova Launcher to get my own customized look.

10367,Do you think Samsung will extend update for S23,k8tdkna,Broder7937,4 year update policy was introduced with S21 FE so previous to S22. 4 years is plenty if you buy the phone at launch. Guess what most people dont. The problem with 4 years is that many people will buy the phone one or even two years after launch. For example I know many people who are now getting the S21 FE especially as now that the S23 FE is out S21 FE prices are rapidly dropping. When the S21 FE first came out with Android 12 going all the way up to Android 16 felt like great longevity especially given its predecessor the S20 FE already stopped on Android 13. But now that were already on Android 14 Android 16 doesnt seem that far away its literally just two OS updates away. I usually keep my phones for at least 3 years and Ill go past 4 years if I can. I take extreme good care of my devices and my battery so I can stay that long with my phones. If I get a phone thats already 2 years old Ill run out of OS updates before I switch my phone. Sure I can just run the older OS but we all know its not the same thing. Software today is just as if not more important than hardware. So no 4 OS updates isnt really that much. And also no. I dont think Samsung is changing that for the S23. If they ever change it Ill be valid for future models only and wont retroactively apply to older models just like the S20 FE is not getting Android 14 despite the fact Samsung still sells the S20 FE.,1,0,GalaxyS23,17spk3i,0,10,2023-11-11 18:18:29,Top,11,

I watch a lot of videos from streaming and YouTube on my tablet. Also really good for reading taking notes or drawing. Can use Wacom pens with Samsung tablets capable of using spens. The newest Samsung tab is the galaxy S9 and S9. But those cost way too much for me. My husband has iPhone and iPad. Theyre okay. I returned the iPhone 15 pro before getting what I got.

There is an important step where a weight is placed above the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor overtop the tempered glass and glue while its still wet which ensures a very strong bond and no issues with said sensor.

When I use my Galaxy buds it will use settings X and when Im connected to Android auto it will use settings Y. Best App purchase Ive made. Edit it also has a bass tuner heres the description Bass tuner Bass tuner allows you to set a very precise bass boost or reduction. This can be useful if your speaker system has a resonant peak in the lower frequencies or a point where long soundwaves cancel each other out. Bass type Allows you to choose between natural transient compressor and sustain compressor types. The transient compressor adds the possibility to increase or decrease the initial bass punch. The sustain compressor preserves the transient and is able to increase or reduce the rumble. This can be used to reduce resonance without compromising the initial kick or to make balanced armature drivers sound less anemic. Cutoff frequency determines until what frequency the sound is processed. Postgain sets the gain to compensate for. This value can either be negative or positive.,3,2,GalaxyS23,14l7vm0,0,3,2023-06-28 13:44:28,Top,8,

The Airpods Pro 2 probably slightly better than the Buds Pro 2 but Id say the sound difference doesnt make up for the better ear fit for me personally and the more compact form factor both inear and the case. Honestly surprised that of all the Apple things you cou have paired with the phone it wasnt the watch but then again despite the Apple Watch being better integration is more important and again I prefer the Galaxy Watch anyway.,2,1,GalaxyS23,14jqa4k,74,85,2023-06-27 02:47:51,Top,88,

10541,Today was a good day screw samsungs earbuds,jpq7pzl,Sayya143,Buds Pro hurts my ears after 2 months it feels tiring after 2 hours. Buds 2 Pro and Buds 2 are superior in every way. AirPods Pro is a bit more superior in comfort because it stays on the tip of the ear instead of going inside the ears this way you forget you were wearing them Whereas you can feel Samsungs Buds but very comfortable. Anyway Buds 2 is comfortable and tiny compared to the others I tried. I wouldnt recommend AirPods Pro for sound quality only just for the comfort and Transparency mode. Apple also has very responsive feeling Spatial Audio 360 Audio compared to Samsungs B implementation of it. Samsung on stock EQ is way better sounding Apple on stock EQ sounds a bit backseated AirPods Pro Gen 1. I switched from AirPods Pro after 3 long years after 1.5 years of OG AirPods to Buds Pro then Buds 2 tried Buds 2 Pro for a bit for context.

10631,why doesnt day life battery last an actual day or so as advertised the battery power actually drains quicker than in a day,jscj1ay,Careless-Tonight-376,Because its advertising laptop companies do the same. They suggest 16 or 20 hours of battery life but in reality it might be around 10 or something. Companies like to say all day because they assume a person is gonna be running one app at a time no apps in the background battery saver and doesnt touch their screen so the screen can drop down to 1 or 48hz and the lowest brightness. It also depends on environment 5g 4g or wifi range and stability are also important. My s22 at launch used to get 2 hours on wifi but now its like 35 on wifi and before it was an hour on data now its like 2. Give it time. Hell they promised 8 hours of battery on my HP and it barely gets past 3 or 4 on normal usage and 2 hours on intense.,5,1,GalaxyS23,15284kn,0,14,2023-07-17 17:56:16,Top,20,

In fact were so paranoid we run aggressive battery management policies on the phone and dont keep apps running in the memory. The marketing and advertisement team saw that I can comfortably reach one actual day through my normal use so they bravely claimed that it can last 1 day.

Step 1 only press the options given. .6 1x 3 10 although yes you can still zoom from there it will look okay.. until for example you get past 30 and decide to use 100 zoom 30 is a sub option you can choose after you first choose 10 when given the options between .6 1x 3 10 2 You have to figure out the Zoom levels and when to not pass too far in each sub category in order to keep quality at its best. Example yes you can go to 100zoom but are you really going to for a photo No. Only to see farther. Stay at 30 and its actually all youll need even at 100 zoom things can end up looking fine just not ideal. But say you try to reach some where similar to how 100 is far fetched FROM option 3 even though its not possible to reach 100 zoom using 3 or 1x.. the principle is the same ..... instead of coming from 10 first and THEN zooming to 30 or 100 again not possible to reach from that camera level until choosing 10 but still the same idea of expanding that individual camera too far Lmk how it goes.,1,0,GalaxyS23,13tlldb,5,31,2023-05-28 02:56:57,Top,32,
10724,Day 1 with my new S23 Ultra.. why are the picturesvideos so blurry,jlwh1gd,BenchLopsided7169,Like others have said upload a picture that you described as blurry and grainy and maybe take the same shots together with your S22 for comparison. So we get the idea what are you talking about. Do you have any camera lens protector on Or case that has camera protector built into it Because i have seen those when i was looking to buy a case. I just upgraded to S23 Ultra few days ago and I also have iPhone 12 Pro alongside my S23 Ultra. Camera is doing just fine on my phone. To say that you like the iPhone photos better is a matter of prefference totally fine.. but if you say your previous S22U photos better is a little concerning.. either you may have the wrong settings since its a new phone maybe you played around with the settings etc.. or your camera lens have some sort of protectors on.. or your S23U is faulty. You may try raise your concern to Samsung or BestBuy so you can exchange to another S23U unit. In my country if a unit is faulty within 14 days of purchase Samsung will replace your phone with a new one regardless from which store you bought it from. I am not familiar with BestBuy policy does exchange will also be charged with restocking fee If not you can exchange it see if the phone was indeed faulty and if the new camera does differently for a couple of days. If you are still not happy then return it and stay with your S22U until iPhone 15 came out in a few months. Best of luck to you i know this sucks but it happens with electronics.

What you should do regularly is clear the phones cache perform regular restarts and especially never get your storage to be more than 90 full.

Each new Samsung phone Ive gotten has lasted in that smooth stage longer and longer. My S5 S7e both probably lasted a year Note8 about 1.5 years and S20 nearly 3 years until they all started slowing down or generally just aging. Even then my S20 is still more than usable in 2023 but Im way happier with my S23U. I can see the S23U hitting the 4 year mark before noticably aging.

If you get 8 hours of SOT then using the same Apps you will know your phone is not defective.

10803,Need Suggestions,k4wwvyw,Traditional-Skill-,Something that could help your situation is to Go into both galaxyGoogle app store settings and dont let it update until you want to get them to update its what I do you dont need every single update every single day. Updating the available apps twice a week or so is just fine unless youre waiting for a specific featire thats about to be integrated in to a certain app you use and since you update twice a week youll still get it . These days if an app has an urgent or mandatory update the app will even prompt you to do it like today when I opened up Twitter It took me to the store to update it. Second you have the S23 base with the smallest battery in the series. Id recommend turning off protect battery it makes less sense to cut short your battery life like that. I have the s23 ultra which has the biggest battery out of the series and I keep protect battery off but do something else. What I do is never let the phone charge to 100 but depending on the use I want to get ill charge anywhere from 90929597 no more than that. It may save the battery a bit less but there is still some protection since it doesnt ever reach 100. Either way Samsung makes their parts more available now and anyone with a 3 year old phone around the time where you noticed real bad battery degradation can replace their battery easier and cheaper now than before. Its actually the recommended option for people after having a phone for so long. Fresh Battery and its wayyy cheaper than upgrading. iPhone users do it all the time at through the apple store. Another suggestion go to Settings Battery Device and CareBatteryBackground Usage LimitsDeep Sleeping AppsPress the sign on the top right start checking off all the apps that you KNOW that you do not use DailyWeekly at all. We all have so many apps not all of them have to be active. The phone will force Deep Sleep those anyways eventually by itself of course but thats overrr time this will help speed up that process as youre helping it along. The apps will wake up when you need to use them on whatever occasion. After that youre in that setting you can check your always active apps and Selectively turn some of those into the First Sleep option under Background Usage limits. I dont recommend you taking any out of there that you would want fast notifications from that have to do with Communication like texting social media video chatting things like Amazon because otherwise their can be delays in you getting notifications from those apps but for me to give you an example apps like the Google app book reading apps bedbath beyond video streaming apps like Netflix Hulu Disney plus that a delayed notification doesnt really matter at all.

I have no problem with connectivity it has bluetooth multipoint so it connects to my S23U and S10 at the same time when I take it out. I can listen to audiovideo and accept calls on both phones too. Jabra also has an app Sound where you can adjust the sounds to your preference and some models like mine has Find My Jabra feature incase you lost it and forgot where you last used it. Calls are clear too. Anc is okay but I can still hear the surroundings if the music is not that loud which is what I prefer coz itll be scary when walking on the road otherwise. My only prob with this model is I can only use mono in 1 earbud. Which is why Im looking for newer models where both earbuds can be used separately since amazon seems to be on sale.

Slightly better memory management in S23. It means most of the apps are stored in memory and they can be retrieved at any time. 2. Performance is same despite 120hz refresh rate I didnt feel significant difference in scrolling. 3. Cameras are slightly better in S23. 4. Battery life and consistency is better in iPhone 13. 5. S23 can be operated with single hand much conveniently compared to iPhone 13. 6. Display is more or less same. However s23 has prominently highest display limit. 7. Animations and haptics are better in iPhone 13. I think it may not be a good idea to switch to s23 considering the price difference.,1,1,GalaxyS23,1623itg,1,20,2023-08-27 16:55:19,Top,22,

10873,Help me decide between 13 pro or s23 base,jdrkfr3,jmydy,I was using iPhone 13 pro a year ago and S23 this year. iPhone was delivering more premium feel because of nicer screen and superb haptics. Call quality was great also on loudspeaker. It was much heavier and not so comfortable to hold without case because of frame design. Battery life was good too. Cameras were very good. I didnt like the iOS as it was lacking simple things in comparison to Android. As nonUS customer I didnt like how iOS was forcing me to use Apple Maps. I prefer Google Maps. iOS was complaining all the time it wants Apple Maps. There was something wrong with how animations were implemented. There was occasional stuttering. So despite 120Hz it wasnt operating buttery smooth. S23 is lighter and has perfect form factor. I really appreciate its quite small and light. Its display will look washed out in comparison to iphone well it looks washed out compared to some cheaper Samsung phones. Its very bright though. So just check it yourself maybe my eyes are very picky about colors Cameras didnt impress me that much and there is too much of postprocessing quite often photos look artificial. Haptics as well. Its just not iPhone level. It operates super smooth Snapdragon 8gen2 is super fast. It has good battery life. Overall very good phone but display is not 1010. Side note both are very pricey in my country but S23 is bit cheaper. Well tbh I just checked and I cant find new 13 pro anymore... Regarding Samsung be aware that you should pick 256gb version as it has faster UFS 4.0 storage. I like Samsung OneUI and I think it goes in right direction. I would buy S23 from outlet. Its new model so youll get few years of updates. And as I mentioned its comfortable to use so its what you need. But... You might like iPhone cameras more.

10874,Help me decide between 13 pro or s23 base,jdqtax0,Queue098,I had the 13 Pro and switched to the base S23. If you can find a good deal on the s23 try switching and using it for a week to see how you feel about it. I personally love the weight and the fact I can hookup my phone to a pc and have it transfer all photos and videos with ease vs using iTunes and it slow transfer. I also liked the choice the smart watches vs Apples offering functionality is lost with any watch outside an apple watch. I find battery life to be just a tad worst on the s23 I do run everything and dont power limit or turn off 5g but still manage a good 56hours of SOT.,3,1,GalaxyS23,122lff7,1,22,2023-03-26 13:49:47,Top,26,

Here are some things that I noticed The S23 is much lighter and feels much nicer in the hands I think the screen looks a bit better on the S23 S23 has thinner bezels and a smaller Notch They are both incredibly snappy and smooth Battery life seems to be about the same very good The S23 has more features and OneUI is very good Generally it comes down to wether you prefer IOS or Android personally even tho the S23 seems like an incredible phone I might probably stick with the iPhone since it works so well with the iPad and Mac.,2,0,GalaxyS23,122lff7,1,22,2023-04-05 15:50:31,Top,24,

After a while it doesnt really bother me though and Im generally very picky about such stuff. That said my first unit was lemon as it had some black spots or Mura at the status bar area I noticed viewing angles on the S23U are generally poorer than on the S22u.

10898,battery life on S23 256GB,j9qk7vj,Zak_--,Light mode will do nothing to battery life. It only caps your CPU to 90. Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is already extremely efficient at 100 so you will not notice any gains in battery life. What light mode is really aimed at is controlling the CPU temperatures so they dont spike under heavy loads. I noticed the CPU goes to 42 degrees under load in standard mode while it never exceeds 38 degrees using light mode. But thats it.

If you want to joke around there are plenty of pages for that sort of content. Our phones cannot have a burn in. This all I found is from 2022 and only applied to older models where they FIXED the issue. Your issue is a question to see IF it would burn on YOUR phone specifically bc you are using a device that is faulty or a network that is having extremely serious issues. It has NOTHING to do with the community. If you have questions for you specifically then just state that instead of being comical where others dont know if youre being serious or not. If I want to laugh I go to other pages.

Also disabling or removing apps I dont use and disabling notifications from apps I only check occasionally has helped. Camera is going to be subjective. I cant provide insight there being that the Ultra has a different main camera. As for your screen scratch that is totally on you. The glass isnt going to be any harder on other brands. You should have put a tempered glass screen protector on it day one if you carry your phone in a way that can cause scratches.

I play a lot of Pokemon Go on the Pixel 2 if I opened an app like the camera it would kick Pokemon Go out of RAM and it would need to load from scratch again. The S20 got rid of this problem. Having the extra ram is nice because I can now keep two instances of Pokemon Go open Play Store and Galaxy Store at the same time while also being able to do a couple other things without anything getting kicked out of RAM. All of that said it may be possible to still do the above on 8GB. Im planning on upgrading to an S23 sometime this year.,2,0,GalaxyS23,11jy2h9,3,38,2023-03-06 17:17:59,Top,40,

Cant even keep some Chrome tabs in RAM all day without it refreshing at some point. This is for both the S21U and S23U although Ive noticed its better on latter. Meanwhile the phone will say it has 46GB free RAM but not put it to use. I doubt 8GB will be much worse. And for your use case it wont be a big deal at all. And in regards to the exchange process you get the new phone first and then have about two weeks to mail out the old phone. You will never be asked to give your old phone first that would be absolutely ridiculous as most people cant be without a phone these days.,1,3,GalaxyS23,11jy2h9,3,38,2023-03-06 16:01:46,Top,42,

Ill click it in all the way and later its popped a little out. I think it mustve been popped a little out and the jar of the fall knocked it out and it snapped.

11180,Is the banana gate still on S23,jqiopkq,catalinus,Bananagate is a very specific issue and not all S23 units have it in fact possibly less than 10 of them have it. True bananagate is when you take a picture of a flat object like a newspaper at a decent distance at least 0.5m and while you have the phone steady and perfectly parallel to the subject the resulting picture has one or more zones possibly with a weird shape like a banana that are out of focus while most of the picture is sharp. This is different than depthoffield focus results which too often are reported as bananagate by people that do not understand depthoffield also different than minimal focus distance issues which again people misreport often. I did get last week a base S23256 in EU for a member of the family and it did not have any bananagate problems but when you are not very careful with your composition and you expect too much and also you do not activate Prioritize focus over speed in Camera Assistant you get pictures where you get to see depthoffield focus issues.

The focus and camera quality doesnt compare to the iPhones because it is better if u know how to use it. If u buy the S23 series ur battery wont even last a few hours but a whole damn day. The refresh rate doesnt feel like 60 or even 90 hz because it is a super smooth 120hz. I am no one to say this but u might get addicted. So buy it at ur own risk.

11214,Wanted to buy S23 but one thing stops me,jzsy2wb,thatguy11m,Coming from the S9 running at 1440p to the S23 at 1080p it took maybe a day of initially noticing but after that I have not noticed it all since even when I did notice i think it was more of me being intentional to spot it cause when I didnt think of it I was just amazed by the slightly updated UI. Even now when I borrow my moms S22 Ultra running 1440p I barely notice the difference. The resolution difference simply does not have much visual effect at these small sizes at least not as much in terms of battery which in itself isnt much difference. Biggest differentiating factor would likely be the price which we as consumers will feel more.,4,0,GalaxyS23,16e0qna,0,56,2023-09-09 11:54:20,Top,60,

11216,Wanted to buy S23 but one thing stops me,jztgfkg,torpidninja,Im not gonna lie I have the S23 and the pentile screen was the first thing I noticed. At the time I didnt know what it was and thought the screen was defective coming from a Poco X3 Pro with and LCD display I expected the S23s OLED to blow me away. Resolution wise it looks worse than a regular 1080p RGB screen because it is in my opinion they shouldnt allow them to call it 1080p if it has less subpixels but thats a debate for another day. I dont know how this isnt mentioned in any review maybe people need glasses or something I really dont get it its like reviewers just gave them a pass and not just to Samsung other brands also do this we are going backwards. The phone excels in every other aspect tho. I hate curved screens and like the size of the S23 but I regret not getting the Ultra because the pentile screen makes it look cheap af. If they made the s23 with 1440p advertised it would be the perfect phone for me sadly I dont think they will do it with the S24 as thats one of the reasons why people get the Ultra.,2,1,GalaxyS23,16e0qna,0,56,2023-09-09 14:22:44,Top,59,

S23 density is about 10 lower so in normal usage it shouldnt be a problem at all and I dont think that they will increase resolution in S24 as only very few people demand that and raised price would definitely decrease sales,1,0,GalaxyS23,16e0qna,0,56,2023-09-09 10:25:19,Top,57,
