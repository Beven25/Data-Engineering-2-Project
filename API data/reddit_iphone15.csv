That can be a good thing though because then you'll know when it needs to be cleaned. However, the black one lets you know when it's dusty. lol Life is full of important decisions.

Anyway, yeah spend some time at an Apple Store and you'll see how poorly some people treat the display models. I'm not surprised some of them are scratched up. Think about this too: each iPhone is handled by tons of people every day, and at minimum *some* of those people aren't careful at all because of the attitude that it's not ***their*** iPhone ""so who cares?!""

35,18W Charger for iPhone 15 Plus,kcs3e38,TwoCables_from_OCN,"The person at T-Mobile doesn't have any knowledge (which isn't a surprise). So yes, it's safe. It's electrically the same, it just has a different wattage capacity to supply to the iPhone.

Also, it's not a charger. It's a power adapter. More accurately, it's a power **supply**. The charger is inside of the iPhone. It has always been this way. The iPhone 15 Plus's charger peaks at 25-27W (I've seen people say 25W and I've seen people say 27W, so I'm going to say 25-27W). So this means your iPhone's charger will never get any more than 18W for charging which is just fine. It also means you could use a 30W power adapter or an even bigger one and it would ***still*** only go as high as 25-27W.

Generally, never ask mobile service provider employees technical questions like this. It's always best to just do the research on your own and just let them handle questions like details about the mobile plans.",2,0,0,iphone15,18f6bvt,1,1,2023-12-10 16:21:24,Top

142,Camera quality,kcn1frr,InevitableNo90,"OP!  I get you!   I completely agree and understand with what you are talking about.  Most people like better photo quality, but the problem is, as your camera gets better, you have to improve your photography skills, or you will capture every blemish and issue in a photograph.   

Unfortunately, you‚Äôre probably gonna have to learn to edit your photos and smooth them out.   Broadcasters, news casters photographers etc have all encountered the same issue and problem as camera and video technology has improved across the board, screens have improved.  Now you see blemishes and detail that you didn‚Äôt want to see and you lose the unintended but beneficial bokeh effect of a poor camera that now can capture an entire image blemishes and background and all.

You‚Äôre gonna have to do a few things to compensate
1.  There‚Äôs not really a way to ‚Äúdumb down‚Äù the camera so to speak.  
2.  Get a free program like snapseed and edit your photo with the ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù editing option.  
3. There are portrait editors that will remove blemishes 
4.darken your exposures
5, pay attention too your backgrounds and what‚Äôs in the background when snapping the photo.

Practice and play around with the camera settings. Also don‚Äôt take pictures of ugly people with blemishes.  Photograph gorgeous people only.  That helps a lot too!  Works for me!",1,0,0,iphone15,18e7k8n,0,13,2023-12-09 15:12:54,Top

if i recall correctly, ever since the 14 lineup, there is some sort of extreme sharpening, and selfies might look unflattering and ""pore revealing"".

on the other scale,  android phone especially from the asian markets, that prefer to give faces a ""clay-like"" smooth face effect.

it might help to edit the picture and lower the sharpness/defenition/contrast/increat brightness etc...

It just takes 5 minutes to google the difference between the different models of the 15 series and apple has even made a simple ui comparison page on its website for simple minded people folks as well. From this you can deduce if you want those features or not and if you want to pay the price for the same. They have also included battery times too.
If you cant do such simple things why do you even exist ? 

People stop spoon feeding such idiots. And prevent reddit from being spammed with people who wants everything put into their mouths

233,Sticky iphone 15 power button,kcc7zpd,TwoCables_from_OCN,"Give the button a paper towel sponge bath. I'm serious: fold a paper towel into a small square or rectangle, soak it with water, and then squeeze out most of it while leaving about 25% of the water behind.

With the button facing up, start gently squeezing the water in very small amounts, pretending you are shrunk down to such a small size that you'd be about as tall as the button if you were standing on the iPhone next to the button. Imagine you're down there directing what's happening and that you need just enough water to go in and around the button area but nowhere else if possible. Press the button through the paper towel ""sponge"" many many times to help work the goo loose and to wash it away with this paper towel sponge bath. As such, press it a few times, flip the ""sponge"" over, press it a few times, change how it's folded to get a clean spot, press it a few times, etc. Imagine that when you press, the goo gets diluted and cleaned away and it dirties the paper towel.

To dry, press and hold with a dry paper towel or clean absorbent cloth. Blow into the button hard to get any excess water that might be in there. After blowing, you might see a little more water come out, so of course just dry it up.

If it's just a sugary substance, this will work beautifully. I am speaking from experience. It won't hurt your iPhone if you do it this way.

I came up with the idea when I envisioned simply putting the button under running water, but of course I had to figure out how to do it ***safely***. This is how, and you don't have to go anywhere to have it done (not to mention waiting for a tech to get around to ***your*** iPhone).",1,0,0,iphone15,18cpmp0,2,4,2023-12-07 07:19:20,Top

273,iPhone 15 base vs. 15 pro - photo resolution and storage data?,kcbf93f,flowinginthewin,"The regular 15 should be enough. The 2x ''zoom'' is fine for 99% of scenarios. However, the lack of zoom will affect quality for let's say 5x shots. Pictures will lack details on non-Pro. Fast forward 3 years from now when that kid will be in school : do you care about not getting better quality shots for let's say sports event, plays, beach, vacation, or whatever school events he's in? It's marginal scenario's and for 99% of shots the regular should be fine and still okay at 5x, but you got to think about it. Plus, the Pro gives you extra zoom for video recording : 9x VS 6x for the regular, with better quality too because of the lenses. 

If you want to takes lots of photos and video, I would definitely go for the 256Gb storage just to be safe and store those videos as well. 

In term of storage, Apple says that a 24MP photo should be on average 3Mb, while a 12MP one should be  on average 2Mb. So, 1Gb can give you 334 24MP photos or 500 12MP photos on average. There is no difference between the Pro and regular 15's in term of space taken by photos. What matters is the details. Taking pictures of trees with lots of leaves takes more storage than a restaurant menu.  

Higher resolution should not be a factor when printing photos for books since they are small. It's only a factor if you watch them on TV or PC screen. You don't notice it if you scroll to your photo library on phone and I disabled it for that reason. 

As for the 14 Pro, it's basically the same as 15 Pro (excluding the Max models), but it's locked at 12 MP. 24MP is not possible. It's a safe option because of the zoom lenses. Again, no differences in picture size (if comparing both 12MP shots). It's the content that matters. Pictures should be on average 2Mb too.",1,0,0,iphone15,18cbjfi,5,4,2023-12-07 02:46:07,Top

I would pick iPhone 15 Pro for 120Hz and 3x zoom. It's the best deal. If you have money go with 15 Pro Max.",8,0,0,iphone15,18aqbu6,7,18,2023-12-04 18:36:25,Top
387,Which one?,kbzmyiv,Jacorpes,"I upgraded from the XR to the base 15. I don‚Äôt regret it at all and I‚Äôm saying that as someone who likes tech would notice the differences on the pro.

120hz is great on my PC for proper gaming and work, if I wanted to shoot telephoto or export raw images I would use a proper camera. It‚Äôs not worth paying an extra ¬£200 to have those features on my phone when most of the time I‚Äôm just shooting stuff to go on social media where it gets compressed anyway. 

¬£800 is worth it for a phone that‚Äôll see me through to the iPhone 20 though, which the base 15 definitely will.",7,0,1,iphone15,18aqbu6,7,18,2023-12-04 19:02:08,Top
388,Which one?,kc2knxc,ED7tron,"I have both standard 15	and 15 pro max. I bought 15 PM on launch day and got the standard 15 two days ago. Apart from telephoto lens and bigger screen on 15 PM I don't feel a difference in day to day usage. I have switched my main sim card to standard 15. Imo go with standard model and save. They would upgrade the screen size to 6.9 inch on 16 pm. Wait till then to switch to a pro max model.

595,My iPhone takes time to turn on when I press the power button,kbnv14o,TwoCables_from_OCN,"It's not happening to me, but if it were, I'd try these things:

1. Restart (so do ""Slide to power off"" or just ask Siri to turn off your iPhone)
2. Restart this way:
   1. Press the Volume Up button one time
   2. Press the Volume Down button one time
   3. Hold the Side Button until the display goes black. Release the Side Button and simply wait for the iPhone to restart.
3. Do an iPhone Restore:
   1. Do an iCloud Backup
   2. Connect the iPhone to a computer, PC or Mac.
      1. If a PC, then use iTunes for Windows or use Apple Devices Preview, both available in Microsoft Store.
      2. If a Mac, then use Finder
   3. Click your iPhone in iTunes/Apple Devices Preview/Finder (whichever the case may be)
   4. For good measure, back up your iPhone to the computer
   5. After that, click ""iPhone Restore"" and ignore the message about backing up because you already did.
   6. It will download iOS 17.1.2 and set your phone back to the way it was the day you unboxed it (but with iOS 17.1.2)
   7. When you see Quick Start, tap ""Set Up Without Another Device"" at the bottom
   8. It will go through the initial setup steps (like basic settings and Face ID, Apple Pay, etc.) and eventually it will give you the chance to restore the iCloud Backup. So of course, restore it, wait for it to download it, and then you will be able to go back to using your iPhone the way it was before you started this.

So this just means you start by restarting. Failing that, try the different kind of a restart that takes more steps to complete. Failing that, do an iPhone Restore.

If I have my 15 Plus on a fast charger (USB-C with Power Delivery) the phone will heat up and will get pretty warm. Never enough to be uncomfortable to hold, though.

Constant over-exposure to heat will diminish the lifespan of the battery. This is why I still use the 5W Apple power adapter with a USB-A to USB-C cable overnight. I only use fast charging when I need some extra juice. 

If your phone gets uncomfortably hot while charging, to the point where you can't hold it, that's not normal. Getting warm and feeling some heat is normal though.

Just my two cents. Hope this helped.",1,0,0,iphone15,188eq9s,4,1,2023-12-01 16:27:46,Top

The battery is better so you have less anxiety during a heavy use day. And to me, battery is important so I‚Äôm happy with it.

The 15 plus is actually a great phone. Extremely lightweight (lighter than the smaller 14 pro) while boosting the same screen size and comparable battery duration of the pro max. The new color infused back adds an additional premium feeling to it, essentially feeling like a pro model with an aluminum frame. 

Both come with usb-c and new form factors that make the device SOOOOO much more comfortable to hold without a case. The color options will honestly sway you which way to go. The Natural Titanium gives me that grayish-taupe vibe and was a hit with me off rip. The color choices for the 15 plus‚Äô are actually a hit with me as well.

796,iPhone 15 pictures reduced image quality after taking,kb35xko,TwoCables_from_OCN,"Taking good photos of the moon can be difficult and it can require lots of attempts and therefore lots of patience - at least until you get the hang of it.

The gist of how to get started is: zoom in and then tap the moon and then take the photo. Hold the iPhone as steady as you can throughout all of this. By tapping the moon, you're telling the camera what to focus on. Yes, you still want to reduce the exposure almost all the way down, but you have to tell the camera to focus on the moon.

So by doing this, you're telling the camera app where to prioritize the focus. This is why you have to hold as steady as you can because you have to keep the moon in the same place where you tapped. Again, it's not easy and it can require several attempts.",1,0,1,iphone15,1856ccu,5,7,2023-11-28 06:54:24,Top

My friend with the 15 Pro Max says his battery is fantastic. I think the larger format phones just have much better battery life.

It's not all about the display. My battery just drains and drains overnight, even when I activate LPM in Sleep Focus.

For the record, I'm not saying I need to charge it multiple times daily, but I'm not a super heavy user. If I were, I would. I don't know if this is an iOS 17 thing or the fact that I have a smaller phone now.

But before I had the 13 Pro Max, I had a 13 Pro regular, and it seemed fine. So maybe this is an iOS 17 thing.",10,0,1,iphone15,184ee7l,12,27,2023-11-26 16:36:40,Top

When I got it, I did the direct phone-to-phone transfer and then as I began living with it, it would get warm for things my iPhone 11 ***never*** got warm for. For example: a few hours of listening to SiriusXM. Just little things like that.

So then just to see what would happen, I did an iCloud Backup, then I did an iPhone Restore and then I restored from that iCloud Backup and ever since then it no longer gets warm for things that never made my iPhone 11 warm! So yeah, I'm very happy.

From my personal experience Iphone 15, not the pro will do the job, pro is only for professional photographers.as I had understand!

I make a great choice to buy the iPhone 15 Plus and I have not regretted, I am impressed from the quality, sometimes I use again my previous Pixel divice and I getting shocked how bad was the user experience....

The 15 is the best value for a fresh new iPhone with so many awesome features. It has more than the others before. It has almost everything the pro has minus the 120 display, action button, third lens, and the same chip as 14 pro. 
I was going to get it because it is such a good deal but I chose the blue 15 pro 256gb since I got a lot of money for my birthday and am in a spot financially to pay the extra amount. 
15 is very future proof with the new port and the chip is going to be incredible for a long time. I hope Dynamic Island stays on phones and more developers use it. It is a very fun feature to use. 
My suggestion for buying an iPhone is get AppleCare. It is so worth it. I got the theft and loss plan cause I can‚Äôt afford to replace a 1200 dollar phone lol but the basic Apple care is also great. They will replace your battery for free once it drops below 80% capacity. 
Also for me 256gb is necessary because I love to use my camera also and take high spec pics. I also download all my music at the highest quality and several YouTube videos for when I‚Äôm out at college or running errands. It‚Äôs only an extra 100 and I highly recommend it.

Similar to you, I made switch from android & the iPhone 15 plus is my 1st iPhone & I gotta say I like it a lot more than I initially thought cuz I realized liked Samsung previously.

The camera on the regular 15 is actually really good & the usbc made it easier for the switch cuz I used my old android charger before getting a new one for my iPhone.

I heard that the only difference for the camera for the base vs pro is the extra zoom so if that‚Äôs something u want to have I‚Äôll say 15 pro over 14 pro. 

Newest model means longer support, usbc is great when coming from android, and it‚Äôs honestly a great phone.",1,0,0,iphone15,1831p9g,14,21,2023-11-25 05:29:10,Top

If you stare at your phone all day(7-14 hours of SoT daily), you might appreciate carrying a larger device. That said, the mini is an excellent viewing experience for anyone with average or better vision. 

Another thing is the RAM. 4GBs vs 6GB will be noticeable if you multitask a lot, use heavy apps, or expect good RAM management to excel for many years on newer versions of iOS.

I will say this, the question doesn‚Äôt contain enough detail. Without any detail, it most would choose the 15 in a heartbeat. There‚Äôs a reason that form factor is dominant. A good way to think about it is the mini targets one handed use, the standard 5.8‚Äù and 6.1‚Äù models target one and a half handed use, and the Plus and Max models target two handed use.

You mentioned you like watching videos on your phone, and you plan on vlogging with it. There‚Äôs no better generation to get a 6.7‚Äù iPhone than this current one. 

- Streaming videos and using the camera will use significant battery, and **iPhone 15 Plus** has the **best battery life** out of the current lineup.

- 15 plus does not have an extra gigantic lense that will weigh down the phone, and the build of the base models are already very lightweight, especially this generation. 

- The edges of the 15s are curved compared to previous generations, which makes it significantly easier to hold.

Basically, going for the bigger size is more of a benefit in your case and gives you almost nothing to worry about.

The titanium frame isn't for improving durability; it's for making the iPhone lighter than it otherwise would be due to physics and just due to the entire iPhone having less mass overall compared to the previous Pro models. The aspect of physics is just simple: since there's less weight around the circumference of the iPhone, it feels lighter when you move it, especially any on-axis rotations in any direction. Like if you wobble it a lot.

Anyway, from what you said, I think you'd be 100% happy with the 15 Plus.

- I love the dynamic island, especially with music if I‚Äôm in another app it is so easy to control. 

- Battery life is amazing, I‚Äôm 17 so you could only imagine I‚Äôm on my phone all day. To make the battery health last long. I only charge when I‚Äôm at 1% and throughout the day I charge to 25 when I‚Äôm low. But I only really ever charge it at night

- Size is just the right size, I got the base model and I wouldn‚Äôt want anything bigger because the plus and the max are just too big for my liking. 

- Cinematic mode and just the camera in general is amazing. Me and my friends were pretending to shoot a music video and it looked so real. 

- USB C is great too as the only device left in my ecosystem that was using lighting it is just the best to plug it in whenever and wherever. 

- 5G works miles better than LTE 

Thats really it, I also got it for cheap because of this deal with T-Mobile and I ended up getting free tech21 case, apple watch se for a dollar a month, airtags, tempered glass, and a 20w power brick to go to the collection. So I do not regret this whatsoever.

1497,Iphone 15 or Pixel 7?,k9usvef,sirhc9114,"Pixel 5 to iPhone 15 here. I loved the pixel line. Had the original, pixel 2, and pixel 5. When the 6 came out I was not a fan of the design, fingerprint sensor removed, and look of the phone. I also have been a bit tired of the android look as well. Sure they can do a lot but just was getting a bit old to me. I was interested in getting an iPhone 15 but came across a promotion that let me trade in my pixel 5 for the full value of an iPhone 15 so I went with that. I had never owned an iPhone before but so far I really enjoy it. There are obviously absolutely idiotic things that iPhone just doesn‚Äôt let you do like android does but overall I have enjoyed it. You obviously would have to be willing to switch ecosystems but I think that‚Äôs what Apple really excels at compared to android or google. If not spending anything is more important to you just to get an upgrade I‚Äôd say get pixel 7 if you are really enjoying the 6. However the 6 to 7 doesn‚Äôt really seem like much of a jump of improvement. Why not go for the 8 if you really want an upgrade? Going to just a 7 for me would be a bit underwhelming. Otherwise I know you could get at least like 300 off an iPhone 15 with trading in your pixel 6 if it‚Äôs in good condition with mobile retailers",4,0,2,iphone15,17yow73,3,7,2023-11-19 05:08:36,Top

Then I wanted to get an iPhone 15 pro because we like that size because pixel 8 pro is like a plus. but from some reviews I saw that the regular iPhone 15 is very good, costs much less and also has many pro features. the only thing is the telephoto lens, but it does this with the 2 cameras, so you have a kind of digital extra camera. LiDAR and 120HZ doesn't matter to me. And the titanium will be much stronger, but I use a case so that doesn't make much difference. So that's why I ordered the iPhone 15 512 Gb in blue and it's great.

The base 15 is less equipped than the S21. It will be a signifiant downgrade in hardware IMO, but an upgrade in software (for the ecosystem, the rest is subjective).

No more dedicated zoom lenses, no AOD, no 90Hz+ refresh rate, no more software enabled mute mode if you go to the 15 Plus. You get those features with the 15 Pro Max. Now, they are not required for your tasks but still, they will be gone. The lack of telephoto (zoom) is probably an issue, but probably not for close up pictures like you seem to do. 

So make your choice. If you loved and used these features, they will disappear for quite some time unless you get buyer remorse and switch. Other than that, the 15 Plus can be fine.

The screen is very usable on bright sunny day and battery life is way better. The 2x is somewhat better on the 12 Pro vs 2x digital zoom on the 15. The weight is way better on the 15. The horizontal face unlock is very underrated IMO and a great feature. Dynamic Island is a goodie, but not the greatest best thing ever. Satellite and crash detection are not a factor for most people. Of course, there is USB-C. It‚Äôs a one and done troublesome situation if you have 5 lightings cable for bed, car, travel and work, but a change is inevitable. 

That‚Äôs about it.

The 12 Pro to 15 is an iPhone change that gives USB-C, a more usable screen on sunlight , better battery life, better main camera and some small software features, but comes with a little downgrade on 2x zoom details IMO.

1850,What improvements can they make now?,k93jo9x,TwoCables_from_OCN,"Maybe they will find a way to have everything for the selfie camera and Face ID be under the display so that there's nothing but display. Not even a tiny little hole. What I mean by ""find a way"" is, finding a way that satisfies their high standards.

Maybe they will also find some way to no longer need any kind of a port, like what we have now with the USB-C port. Perhaps something is coming we can't even imagine right now, something wireless like Bluetooth but better.

I'd like true wireless contactless charging somehow. Just have some sort of a Tesla-like transmitter that can charge the iPhone.

Maybe camera technology will advance so much at some point that the iPhone camera system can include a mirrorless camera.

Maybe too the camera sensor technology will advance so far that the base models will make today's Pro models very inferior in comparison.

I think it would be fun to have a thermometer on my iPhone. Of course, it would have to be some new advanced thermometer technology that would enable the user to take their iPhone out of their warm pants pocket and get an accurate air temperature reading of the air temperature ***outside*** of the pocket without having to wait for the thermometer to be cooled down or warmed up first, whatever the case might be. This imaginary high-tech thermometer would also be able to tell you the temperature of water by just putting the phone under water. I'm sure by then iPhones will be able to be truly waterproof instead of just being water *resistant*.

I think it would be cool to have true Night Vision from the camera. I know what you're thinking: today we can just use the flashlight. Hear me out though: a flashlight doesn't illuminate everything equally. It has a limited range. With true Night Vision, you could see everything in the dark equally, just like with Night Vision goggles. So then all you'd have to do is turn it on and look at everything around you right on the display.

Another scenario where I'd make use of Night Vision is if I need to see in the dark but I don't want to turn the flashlight on because even at its lowest brightness it can be too bright (where turning it off means I can't see as well as I could in the dark before turning it on). Every once in a while when I'm ready to go to sleep and I have just one light on set to 1% brightness to the color red but I need more light for a sec, I kinda hate using the flashlight even at its lowest brightness because it can be too bright. I'd love to have Night Vision so that I can just turn that on and see what I need to see without being ""blinded"" like I can be for a moment after turning the flashlight off. Plus, it's a very ""alerting"" light.

So, another thing I'd love to have is the ability to change the color of the flashlight. So in the above scenario (without Night Vision), I'd just turn on a red flashlight instead of this bright daylight blue one. So I'm imagining long-pressing the flashlight in Control Center and getting options for color in addition to brightness. That way, I'd choose the color and probably a low brightness and then I'd turn it on.

Oh hey, Night Vision photos and videos.

I got my iPhone 15 Pro from Xfinity Mobile. The day it was delivered, I turned it on and set it up and moved in. Xfinity Mobile needed to be in possession of my old iPhone within 14 days to complete the trade-in. That's far better than trying to do it all in one visit to a store.

2010,are the apple cases good?,k8w2hdw,Edge_Audio,"This is a very personal, and often heated, conversation.

Apple cases are overpriced (as with everything Apple). Now that's out of the way.

Due to a big mix up, Apple offered me some goodwill and I have a Finewoven in green, and silicone in blue, for my 15 Pro Max.

I like both of them!

After three weeks of pretty normal use (not pampering), the Finewoven still looks new. I use a magsafe charger every night and in the car. It's made a slight mark, but also on the leather. I like the feel, fit and finish.

The silicone case I've used for about a week. It has a nice soft feel that's still slick enough to get in and out of a pocket.

The only way to get better selfies are by:
1. Take a burst shot (you can slide to a different frame and it‚Äôll actually look better and more realistic)
2. Take a live photo and choose a different frame as mentioned above
3. Record a video and take a screenshot

1)Snapchat is heavily filtered. You look more like what your pro camera shows. It‚Äôs more sharp, hence the grainy look on a small screen.
2)let your image process a little then go back to it after a few minutes. I found that it takes a while to get the actual coloring to set. Really weird. Almost like you‚Äôre waiting for your photos to develop. 
3.) you‚Äôll want to edit your photos. What I usually do is turn down contrast a tad, up the warmness to your liking, and if you want your pores to slightly disappear, turn up noise reduction. 

I had the X and it basically smoothened out my face. It was lower quality and has a more filtered look. Hence the jarring contrast to your new high quality camera. lol. You‚Äôll get used to your face the more you use your camera.",0,0,0,iphone15,17smfn7,0,10,2023-11-11 08:26:35,Top

It's a consumable/replaceable part. Why reduce the quality of your iPhone experience by effectively shrinking the size of your battery due to never charging past 80% and never letting it drop below 20%? So that it might last a few weeks longer before you have to replace it? smh

Also: if you never deviate from 20-80%, you battery level readings and Maximum Capacity estimate will get less and less and less accurate. This is why using the 80% Limit setting still allows the battery to be charged to 100% on occasion, and this is why it's good to recalibrate the battery 2-3 times per year by doing at least one cycle of 0 to 100%.

People worry too much about their battery.

The battery does get worse with time, battery health is a thing but is not as drastic as people make it look, by the time you feel that your battery is not lasting long enough there is a huge chance that your battery drain is happening because you have so many apps with permissions like background app refresh, push notifications, location services, tracking, etc, and not because your battery has lost most of its juice due to battery degradation, you will probably switch to a new phone before the battery health gets under 80% making the cap useless.

I‚Äôm using the 80% cap myself only because I have a charger at home, at my car, at the office and I never run out of juice during the day with 80% battery, otherwise I would not be capping it if I really needed that 20% so don‚Äôt stressing yourself, if you need the 100% battery then use it, it won‚Äôt degrade fast enough that you would regret it in the long run.",1,0,0,iphone15,17rcovd,8,21,2023-11-20 13:01:20,Top

High quality photos probably means 48MP pictures that can take up to 5Mb (low details) to let‚Äôs say 18Mb (high details like trees at fall season). It will fill up fast, not mentioning 4K videos. I assume you will never compress them or delete them and your current storage is somewhat full. So take the 256Gb. 

I never delete pictures and I always compress them, thus my storage filling rate is not high so 128gb is enough for me. 

Resale value is higher than the 128Gb and can be sold to someone who reached the limit of their 128Gb phone and refuse to delete pictures, compress photos or use iCloud.

- better app quality

- consistent battery life
- good ecosystem 
- bright screen
- reliable 
- good camera 
- ‚Äúit just works‚Äù

cons
- limited customisation
- lack of 120hz? (depends if it‚Äôs a deal breaker)
- usb-c is still on usb-2 (depends if it‚Äôs a deal breaker)
- it‚Äôs a boring phone (can be a good or bad thing depending on the person)
- can‚Äôt sideload apps 

iphone is reliable if all you to is to text, call, watch videos or take pictures. Things like customisation and freedom to modify your phone will be limited through.

2612,is the Red Pocket deal better compared to AT&T and Verizon? https://www.redpocket.com/shop/iphone/apple-iphone-15-pro,k81j1ac,i_speak_the_truf,"Red Pocket is going to be a better deal simply because their service is much cheaper.  Their plans start at $10 a month  including $40 for unlimited data (I think on ATT's network).  

The ATT and Verizon deals lock you in to a device payment plan (and thus $90+ service) for three years.  The best deal from the major carriers right now is probably T-Mobile who tends to have slightly cheaper plans and has you pay off the phone (with trade-in credits) over two years.  Depending on your current carrier, you can get really aggressive with T-Mobile promotions, for me switching from Xfinity, they paid off my 14 Pro balance ($400), offered me $200 credit per line to switch, and gave me $830 in credits over two years with a trade-in.  Also the trade-in doesn't have to be unlocked so you can buy an iPhone SE from WalMart for $150 and trade it in, then sell your (ideally more valuable) existing iPhone on eBay.  Some of the folks on /r/tmobile had also reported buying a Galaxy S9 for $70 on eBay and trading that in for the $830 promotion.

Red Pocket's deal is also better because they give you the full rebate after three months of service.  This is what Xfinity used to do and it was a great deal because you could get a new phone every year for basically free.   The $300 is close to how much an iPhone depreciates over a year so you can pay off your phone at any time, get it unlocked, then sell it on eBay/Swappa when the new phone comes out.  I did this on Xfinity for three years going from  an iPhone 12 Mini to a 13 Pro to a 14 Pro paying nothing out of pocket (except with the 14 Pro they finally forced the rebates over a payment plan like the other carriers do).",2,0,0,iphone15,17nekq2,2,1,2023-11-06 07:22:39,Top

In my opinion spend the extra money on a MacBook pro and iPad with promotion, more bang for your buck! Plus here‚Äôs the thing with the cameras‚Ä¶. the 15 can do about 7/8th the things the pros can do in regard to photography and video things‚Ä¶. If you literally make a living recording hours upon hours of 4K pro res video every week then get the pro‚Ä¶ otherwise get the 15. Also everthing is mute if your well off.

2675,Iphone 15 or go pro?,k7oqkel,Comfortable-Basil-47,"I upgraded from the iPhone 11 to the 15 pro. 

I'll be honest, it was a more of a pity upgrade. I really think next year will have the big changes such as the iPhone 16 ultra and the smaller pro getting the same zoom lens as the 15PM but I really needed to trade-in my iPhone 11 so my trade-in value with my carrier didn't tank.

After watching all the reviews on Youtube, I concluded that the 15 pro was the worst of the entire lineup because of the worst battery. Why did I get it? I just really wanted the 8gb of ram and the smaller form factor. I didn't care about the 120Hz or the action button.

But now having it in my hand, wow. I never knew AOD would be helpful as much as I thought. I don't use it the entire night hooked to a stand or anything but use it for only a couple minutes such as in the morning before heading to class or when I don't have time to actually pickup my phone to check the time(I assume this wouldn't be a problem if you have an apple watch)

The action button was a neat addition and I find it way more useful than the silent switch. You can map multiple actions to the button with some shortcut tricks so I can toggle AOD, set Airdrop to everyone for 10 min, shazam a song, and still keep it as a silent switch. 

Battery life has actually surprised me. It's about the same battery life on 5G and might be slightly better than my iPhone 11 with 4G/LTE. It does get warmer than I would like but I'm hoping it gets better with better optimization for the apps I use in the future. 

TLDR: Get the 15 pro. There's a lot of nice QOL changes that make a big difference. If you can hold it for another year and don't care about trade-ins like I do, get the iPhone 15 now or 16/16 pro next year.

The regular 15 is a good phone, the camera is great and the battery is decent. If you havent had a phone with 120hz, 60hz is definitely still fine.

After a long time of debating and thinking, the Pro does not really offer that much for the added price tag and comes with a slightly worse battery than the base 15.

The 120 Hz display, well, I've had that on the S23, but don't miss it at all on my base 15. Always on, haven't used it on my S23 either, faster data transfers over USB are also not worth it as I'm using Cloud/AirDrop anyway, not cables.

There's the 3x camera, which the S23 has as well, but I used it so rarely and my pictures consist of shooting something when traveling and never looking back at it, it's not worth it.

The only other thing is the action button which I imagine I'd play around with for a while and then set some mundane thing to it anyways and almost forget it's a thing.

Those things alone aren't worth the extra price, weight, and slightly worse battery.

Also I noticed something. 

When you search iPhone X into google, The first result from [Apple.com](https://Apple.com) says "" Sep 12, 2017 ‚Äî Apple announces *iPhone X*, the future of the smartphone,... "" When you do the same with the iPhone 15, you get "" *iPhone 15* and *iPhone 15* Plus. Dynamic Island. 48MP Main camera with 2x Telephoto. All-day battery life. USB-C. 6.1‚Äù and 6.7‚Äù sizes."" 

And for the pro you get ""Gigablast your gigabits. ... *iPhone 15 Pro* is the first iPhone to support USB 3, for a huge leap in data transfer speeds and faster pro workflows than ever before¬†... ""

Notice how they say ""future of the smartphone"" for the iPhone X and just talk about specs of the iPhone for the others. They've essentially built the iPhone 15 and the 11-14 based on the X.

Already set my eyes on yellow since the release despite being a pink girl myself. Banana milk yellow I would say, with soft light pale gold bezel. As a light gold enthusiast, this phone really made me excited when I opened the box. It's a plus btw. Yes, the back is brighter than yellow--almost ivory in natural daylight.

With the 15 Pro, you can at least set up automations that activate vibration mode for certains focus, time of day, locations and Bluetooth devices. You can't on all other iPhone because of the mute switch even if can be bypassed by software, like the emergency bypass on the contact/phone app. 

It's a dated ''feature'' that people seem to love, but don't use it. I feel like it gives them a feeling of safety, because it's in mute mode with a switch, it's in mute mode for good, like a circuit breaker.

3129,iPhone 15PM speaker issue,kbbvhzk,SimoGe83,"Hi!

some days ago I received my 4th iPhone 15 Pro from Amazon...yes, the fourth replacement.

The first one was afflicted by the well-known overheating, so much that it couldn't be held against the cheek during a call... the update didn't solve the issue.

The second device, at maximum volume, emitted a very annoying buzz from speakers during phone calls due to some internal vibration... in exchange for the ‚Ç¨1369 I paid, I expected a device without defects.

Then the third iPhone arrived: the problems with the speakerphones were identical to the second: a buzz appeared while calling, using the speakers as loudspeaker. 

I sent that iPhone back to Amazon and I bought another one...nothing changed also with the fourth device. 

This buzz occurs, something like a vibration, not a distortion or a clipping...it's a clear vibration coming from the speakers or from the inside, which is really annoying when using the speakerphone at maximum volume: obviously I can't use the speakerphone by limiting the volume, it would be a contradiction.

When listening to music or vocal notes as well as recordings, the vibration is still here but less perceived...",1,0,0,iphone15,17iqajt,9,14,2023-11-29 23:09:10,Top

You don't lose much time in getting things back since Messages are stored in iCloud and will sync, email too. Passwords, like you note, in Keychain. Make sure you've stored full res photos in iCloud. 

The main time sink is if you're very particular about how you home screen and others are arranged (and that's where the screenshot would be nice I guess).

So with the first option you will use the full capacity for at least some time, with the second option you will never use the full capacity.
My previous phone was iPhone 11, and battery health is still 83%. So I used more than 80% all the time, if I limited it would be 80 or less for all time.

For typical users that charge at night and then off a charger all day predictably optimized charging works great. The algorithm doesn‚Äôt handle unpredictable charging scenarios very well. 

Truth is these are small batteries and the cost to replace over three years is very small. Lithium batteries hate extremes (extreme heat, cold, max charge, max discharge).

I used the xr for about 4 years now and honestly only in the 1st year did it last the whole day. So by my logic if the 15+ can last a 1-2 days then in the long term at least i can use it one whole day.
3. Dynamic island placement.
Iphone 15‚Äôs dynamic island i feel protrudes more on the screen compared to my xr as the placement is a bit lower. It‚Äôs minute but i noticed it. For the 15 + you get the whole xr screen plus more and the dynamic island is up there. Plus it looks smaller on a bigger screen.

3493,Which leather case is slimmer?,k6ig431,matt_hipntechy,"I'm also in the process of looking for an iPhone 15 leather case. Here's my options and how I evaluated them:

* **Mujjo**: At first glance it looks good, but I don't like the big ""Mujjo"" brand at the back of the case. Also, I have read about many people returning it because it didn't meet their expectations. 
* **Nomad**: I've used a Nomad leather case on my iPhone 12 mini. It's good quality and offers high protection. But it adds more weight and bulk compared to the Apple leather case and the plastic material on the sides doesn't feel as nice in the hands as leather. I'd skip this.
* **Bullstrap**: Looks nice but I don't like the open bottom and at $89 it's too expensive.
* **LONLI**: A decent looking and inexpensive option on Amazon that still seems to offer high quality leather and no branding at all. People seem very happy with it based on reviews. However, on the images it looks thicker and heavier than other options.
* **Andar**: To me it looks quite slim, checks all the boxes and is reasonably priced. I believe this is the closest to the Apple leather case and likely the one people like you and I should get. However, it's pre-order right now and will ship mid November.",2,0,1,iphone15,17gr1g5,7,6,2023-10-26 08:25:45,Top

3556,"For this 15 that i got last week, isn‚Äôt the cycle count too high?",k6mq1v2,TwoCables_from_OCN,"Stop worrying about it. Stop looking at this. The way you use your iPhone determines how quickly you will go through charge cycles. The only way you can slow this down is by using your iPhone less.

Here's how it works: if you were to charge from 50% to 100% two times in a row, then you complete one charge cycle. Or, or if you were to charge from 25% to 100% and then you charged from 75% to 100% after that, you'd complete 1 charge cycle. I'm using simple math on purpose just to keep it easy to understand. You could do 75% to 100% 4 times in a row to complete 1 charge cycle. So you can see it just goes by math.

Here's where I confuse most people though: what I described above isn't describing TRUE charge cycles. A ***true*** charge cycle is 0% to 100% because it affects the ***entire*** battery instead of just a ***portion*** of it. All of my examples above are just portions. Even 5% to 100% is a portion, albeit a huge one.

So just stop worrying about it. Stop caring. It's just a battery. Just enjoy your iPhone! It's absolutely ***useless*** to never charge to 100%, or even to never charge to 80%. Don't you think it's inconvenient to be charging it so damn frequently? Imagine how nice it would be to ***ONLY CHARGE WHILE YOU'RE SLEEPING!*** Let it go to 100% while you're sleeping, wake up, unplug it and enjoy all-day battery life.

Apple state that refurbished devices have new batteries:

*'' Refurbished iOS devices will come with new battery and outer shell. ''*

I would not pick a used phone from carrier or a seller. I have no proof that the battery was changed. It may have been a phone that was swapped after 6 month. The battery may still be at 100%, but it may fall to 98% 3 days after purchase.

An article I can't put in a link says :

*'' Before a refurbished phone is resold, the battery will have been through rigorous testing to make sure it‚Äôs in full working order. In some cases, this* ***may*** *mean that the battery has been replaced.* ***But most of the time***\*, i**t will be the original battery that has been restored to its original condition**''\*

In order word, if it charges, it's all good. That's it.

If it's from Apple, yes. If the refurbished is not from Apple, then I would pick a brand new iPhone 15.",2,0,1,iphone15,17e28o9,25,109,2023-10-23 00:25:23,Top

3954,Do any of you also have ‚Äúfear of missing out‚Äù..,k3yzek2,KsnNwk,"I have no fear of missing out, I have fear of losing value.

So when you buy the newest luxury tech thing, be it car, GPU, iphone, in this example iphone.

They tend to lose most money the first year, so 2-3 months before new iphone releases, current model will lose almost 1/3 of it's value (ca 500-600‚Ç¨). Afterwards the 2nd year it only loses ca 150‚Ç¨ a year.

So going by this, it's better to go with last years model iphone when new one release or during holidays.

That way I can upgrade more often, but the urge for new shiny thing sometimes is overpowering.

I was planning to go with 14 PM when 15PM releases, it costing only 1050‚Ç¨ instead of 1550‚Ç¨. But then 15 PM has USB-C, auto portrait, better HDR, 5x zoom, Action button. All features will help me out.

So most normal people should get last years model, you will be able to upgrade sooner and lose least value.

But then I calculated the difference of price between 14PM vs 15PM, when I deduce taxes, since I get it for company. It ends up being like 300‚Ç¨ and I can get 15PM for 0% fee installments, while for 14PM I would need to shell out $. So I just got the 15PM.

4164,Picked up the blue iPhone 15 today as well as the blue FineWoven case. What do you think?,k2q26nu,theanimaster,"I think the fine woven case is brilliant. Here‚Äôs what no one is talking about: 
1.) Material is all the same - sides are impregnated with a grippy material. 
2.) the grippy material is nice in cases where, if you‚Äôre weird like me, you‚Äôre glued to YouTube even when taking a shower ‚Äî and the grippiness so far has been good enough to keep my iPhone on a tiled ledge ‚Äî and I sure don‚Äôt want to test rumors of the fragility of the glass on my brand new iPhone 15 Pro Max! 
3.) Did I mention it is grippy? Definitely better than my leather cases from Apple.
4.) I don‚Äôt approve of the price ‚Äî this could easily be half of what the leather ones went for. 
5.) The finish is nice. Cloth on cloth feels good in the pocket, and the texture carries through even on the grippy part. It doesn‚Äôt feel cheap at all ‚Äî you can feel the texture on the lip of the case ‚Äî cheap cases don‚Äôt have that attention to detail. You can even see the texture. But again ‚Äî it‚Äôs not just form ‚Äî the grippiness gives it function. 
6.) Action button is a PITA. I keep mistaking it for the volume up button ‚Äî but that‚Äôs not the case‚Äôs fault, and probably the reason Apple only has one operational function for the action button, and it requires a long-press. 

Overall, it‚Äôs a price gouge for a solid, functional product‚Äî but so were the previous Apple leather cases which stained like no one‚Äôs business. We have yet to see how this one holds up after a year. But I‚Äôm impressed so far. I spend more on plastic crack from the likes of Games Workshop, so, yeah.

4404,Optimisation of 15Pro,k4cr2gv,TwoCables_from_OCN,"I've tried using this phone with ProMotion turned off (Settings > Accessibility > Motion > Limit Frame Rate to **on**) and it's unpleasant. It's one of those things where, once you experience it, you don't want to *stop* experiencing it.

So there are better ways to reduce power consumption than that. Like, Auto-Brightness. Go somewhere where you can have absolutely no light whatsoever, like a room with no windows and no lights on. With Auto-Brightness turned on, set the brightness as low as it goes. This sort of ""calibrates"" Auto-Brightness in a way where from that point forward, it will always use a lower display brightness than it otherwise would if you hadn't done that.

You can always reset this by toggling Auto-Brightness off and back on.

Use Dark Mode. I don't like Dark Mode, but Dark Mode reduces power consumption because every OLED pixel is a bit like an individual incandescent light bulb, but one where the color affects power consumption in addition to its brightness: the darker the color is of a pixel, the less power that pixel consumes, and if it's black, it's simply **off!** :)

So, even at 100% brightness but nearly black, a pixel is going to consume ***significantly*** less power than it would if it were some brighter color, like ... white. At a very ***low*** brightness displaying a bright color such as white, an OLED pixel still just *sips* power, but of course it will consume far less if it were producing a **dark** color, and so that's how Dark Mode can help reduce your average power consumption. 

Keep Bluetooth off when you're not using it. Not only does this reduce power consumption, but it increases your phone's security. However, I get that for some people this is extremely inconvenient. So it's just a suggestion.

If your SIM/eSIM allows for it, go to **Settings > Cellular >** tap your SIM or eSIM > **Voice & Data**, and enable ""LTE"".  I have ""5G Auto"", ""5G On"", and ""LTE"". With ""5G Auto"", it's supposed to only use 5G when it's needed for performance  while optimizing battery life, but it uses 5G far more than I expected, like when using Google Maps for real-time navigation. smh I've never had any Google Maps performance problems with LTE. heh

Turn off 'Always On Display'. I refuse to turn this off just to make a tiny reduction in my average power consumption because I freakin' **love** this feature (it's a feature of convenience and luxury and sometimes of necessity), but it's another way you can reduce power consumption. Or, you can make a very very very minor compromise: in **Settings > Display & Brightness > Always On Display**, turn off ""Show Wallpaper"". So the wallpaper area will be black, and as you know, when an OLED pixel is black, it's off in order to be black. You can also turn off ""Show Notifications"" to further reduce power consumption of 'Always On Display'.

Even so, the refresh rate drops to 1 Hz when 'Always On Display' is in use. So when the phone is in its sleep mode while 'Always On Display' is enabled (where the display would normally just turn off - most people call this ""locked""), the refresh rate is at 1 Hz to help minimize power consumption.

There are probably lots of other things you can do to reduce your average power consumption even further, but I suspect they wouldn't make any noticeable difference.

So really, I think it's best to just enjoy it as-is!",2,0,1,iphone15,174haq0,2,5,2023-10-11 00:42:53,Top

Is it worth? Depends. There‚Äôs not a thing I miss about the 12 Pro besides colors. The lack of LiDAR does not influence focus of photography and the measure app still works (don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs less reliable). 

The brightness is VERY noticeable. It‚Äôs visible on sunset. It was hard on the 12 Pro.

The CPU upgrade is not noticeable.

The battery is noticeable, but I was at 92% health. But considering the 6,1‚Äù iPhones 12 lineup battery capacity was a joke (2815mAH, smaller than the 11) it‚Äôs very noticeable considering it‚Äôs now 3300+ maH.

The weight is noticeable. I like the weight loss.

The big question remains about the zoom. You loose the telephoto lenses, no matter if Apple says you get a 2x optical zoom on the 15 (you‚Äôre not : it‚Äôs digital cropping). I will say this : I tried to take the same picture that I took at 2x two years ago on my 12 Pro at around the same distance. Result : the mailbox seemed to have kinda a LITTLE more details on the 12 Pro shot. But I zoomed a lot to notice that. So have this in mind. It‚Äôs kinda equal.

The dynamic island is cute, but not a life changer.

Horizontal Face ID unlock was used quite often. It‚Äôs nice.

USB-C is a blessing and a nightmare. I had to dig my box to get USB C cables to put on my chargers. However, you can finally buy USB-C accessories.

Now, with this in mind, you can make the choice if it‚Äôs financially worth make this upgrade. Without money in mind, I would say it‚Äôs worth an upgrade. A battery swap is almost always the best option to make financially.",1,0,0,iphone15,16yjkbg,0,21,2023-10-03 16:36:56,Top

I'm having a dillema whether I should change my 14 pro for the newly released 15 base model. I can sell my current pro for around what the 15 costs so I most likely wouldnt lose any money in the process. Ever since I got the 14 pro Ive been bothered by its weight and clunkyness. After using in for like 5 minutes the lower half of my hand gets numb and sharp corners make it more difficult to use with one hand. Its also really heavy to carry in pockets so I pretty much completely resort to using bags now.

***Pros:***

\-much lighter phone

\-pink (I would def buy a pro model if if came in pink)

\-slightly rounded corners that make it easier to hold

\-usb c

\-new device experience

\-new battery

\-better main camera

***Cons:***

\-no 120hz display

\-no real difference in usability

\-current battery is at 98% which means its stilll very good

\-no third camera

So far for me the most important arguments for is weight and color, against is lack of 120hz. On one hand I wanna get the 15 on the other hand I dont wanna feel like im making a mistake and downgrading",1,0,1,iphone15,177v972,11,40,2023-10-15 08:38:09,Top

It's really a feature only meant for professionals who knows what they are doing and the best camera is the one you have nearby. While otherwise for professional gigs they have 2000-3000$ cameras.

I called so so so many places within an hour of a half from me, received many no‚Äôs, and for places that did have a pro model, it was the good ol‚Äô black 128g version. I‚Äôm someone who keeps a phone for quite a few years so I wasn‚Äôt going to go for it, but eventually I caved. Drove an hour and 20 minutes away, had the physical cash, and for some reason the system denied the transaction. There was no sort of skepticism surrounding the cash, and it 100% was real cash from the bank. Anyways, very long story short I found a way to order it online and got it in two days. 

Despite all of that, I have absolutely no regrets coming from an iPhone SE 2020. I love high end tech, and damn this thing is nice.

4627,Is it worth it? Xiaomi vs Iphone,k9qwzxo,titiwon,"I recently bought an iphone 15 (the normal one) and swtiched from Android and I totally regret. Let me pinpoint some of the downsides I found:

1. The UI is very clunky. It does not have a backwards button. How ridiculous is to slide upwards to go to the tabs menu, or having to find backwards arrows and crosses to exit tabs or processes. Does not matter the processor, the user experience ends up being slower.
2. Android applications work worse. For example: I am an active google map user and same thing as 1st. Having to do touches slides and other things to access menus and other things difficult the usage.
3. Android applications work worse. Another example is whatsapp, be ready to loose your chats. It is so pathetic you cannot download your google drive backups. There are 3rd party softwares to bring those chats to the iphone. For that you need to allow a 3rd party to decrypt all your messages and handle your data. I would not recommend that.
4. The camera. Total dissapoinment. Main camera, In the night it underperforms with my super old xiaomi remi 8 pro. In the day, obviously way more beautiful than my redmi, but sometimes texts and other things are not so well captured. Front Camera, simply horrible, seems a bit blurry. Forget about details like hairs. Almost as bad as my redmi 8 pro.
5. Apple wants to hook you up by all means with shareabilty applications. I must say airdrop is very good, big shoutout.

tltr; IOS UI is bad and the experience is slow in spite of the processor. Camera is not that impressive (depending what kind of pictures you want). You will not be able to migrate 100% all your data and apps to IOS, be ready to leave things behind.",1,0,1,iphone15,173ntf4,4,10,2023-11-18 09:18:35,Top

4922,Torn between getting the 15 Plus and the 15 Pro,k57zb89,Ljecker31,"Plus is just a bigger screen for a cheaper price because a lot of users didn‚Äôt want to spend too dollar for a pro max if they wouldn‚Äôt use it for all its glory. The pro, granted smaller, has more bells and whistles, the main attraction being the camera. I find the 6.12 inch display to be my favorite as it doesn‚Äôt feel like a brick in the hand or taking up a majority of your pocket like the 6.7 inch screens.

In short, ask yourself what you use your phone for. If you enjoy taking photos and videos, lean towards the pro. If you just want a bigger screen so it is easier to see and don‚Äôt care to use every feature a phone comes with nowadays, go for the plus. You got to recognize your wants and how you use your phone now, to decide and justify which one you want.

Are you gonna take advantage of faster data transfer speeds and attach an external hard drive to your phone via USB-C to record log footage? Do you absolutely need a 120hz display? Or do you prefer a bigger phone and better battery life? The difference between the base and pro models is so minute this year, which is a good thing! I went with the base model 15 and don't feel like I'm missing out on any pro features. Apple is really good at making you think that you'll grow into a ""pro"" phone's features, but then it never happens and you kinda wish you saved a little money and made a different choice. Not saying this happens for everyone, but it does for a lot of people! My coworker was convinced that he needed the 15 Pro Max, but he's used the camera on his 11 Pro Max only a handful of times... I asked him these same questions and he ended up with the 15 Plus and couldn't be happier. At the end of the day though, go to a store and see which one you like the feel of in your hand.

What worries me more is the odd change to a frame and design that allows the iPhone to bend easily, and break the glass too easily.  There's a hollow space behind the back glass that makes it easy to break...even by hand.

I thought that ""titanium"" and ""hardest glass ever"" would make this the first iPhone in a long time that I'd use bare.  But no.  LOL....  Had to back up and order a case after all.

One thing I guess I should know though is: you will never again have to worry about closing apps to manage your system's memory. Like, **ever**.

5093,"Considering buying, but have some concerns:",k5k5twt,autistic_prodigy28,"I was in a similar situation like you when I switched from a samsung to iPhone and I would just say it depends on how you want to use the phone
1- yes the island pill is annoying while watching full screen stuff. Its utility is rather limited too but it‚Äôs better than the old notch on the previous models. You aren‚Äôt really going to notice it in regular use but you will while watching content.


2- like I said it depends. What do you want from your phone? If you want the os to be smooth and reliable then ios is better. But if you want the freedom of choosing what to do with your phone then androids are wayy better. The keyboard on iPhone sucks and I‚Äôm surprised you can‚Äôt change it without downloading another. You can‚Äôt move your apps on the home screen to a more reachable area. You can‚Äôt even download anything outside the app store unless you decide to sideload which is a tedious task anyway. You can‚Äôt download apks which‚Äôs the thing I missed the most but if you‚Äôre ok with these stuff then the ios will probably not be that bad for you. It will take some time to get used to tho.

3-can‚Äôt say cuz i literally came from a 4 yr old 30k phone to an 80k one. The quality is unquestionably better but idk how it compares to other flagships for same price",2,0,1,iphone15,17bjlhp,11,47,2023-10-19 15:50:05,Top
5094,"Considering buying, but have some concerns:",k5kbodo,QWufflez,"Honestly, think about it carefully. I just switched and there a lot of small things that really bother me. Transfer is easy, there's an app that sends over media and supposedly a list of apps. Roughly 2/3 apps showed up on iOS and we're quickly downloaded. But 1/3 I had to search and manually Install. No biggie. 
iOS feels cool, but very limited. Apple tells you how to use your device. You have to adept to their workflow design, many things can not be adjusted.
Keyboards on iOS suck. I used to have a keyboard where I could long press for symbols like question mark on certain buttons. This seems to not be possible on iOS. Also the comma key is not on main keyboard, but you have to switch via 123 button to symbols. Haven't found an option to enable dedicated @ key on main keyboard either. Swiping feels less accurate. Again, tried multiple, Gboard is my favorite so far.
Notifications on the top screen are not a thing. (Small icon of email or WhatsApp for unread notifications). Only in Lockscreen/notficaion Screen.
Control Center (swiping top right down to have quick settings, turn of wifi or so) is rather limited. Can't turn on hotspot from there, can't toggle vibration settings quickly. 
You can't move the home screen, it's always the most left screen (used to have it centered and then to the left one kind of apps, to the right other kind of apps)
Back gesture is finicky. Have to reach to the left most position, can't change it to the other side like on Android. Also some apps don't support back swiping, have to use top left corner.
The pill/island also is weird. Haven't had one before, it bothered me quite a bit. But Im getting used to it slowly. Still seems very odd they can't implement a better solution like everyone else...
Customization is also more limited. You want to rotate background every 10 Minutes or other costum time? Nope, 1h or 24h only. 
Browser extensios only on safari
Quickly to settings from anywhere (pull down and press settings)? Nope, not an option..
Those are just some, to iOS users these seem unnecessary or they didn't even think that would be possible, but that's the way I had my work flows setup. If you don't want to, you didn't have to use it Like thus. That was the beauty of android, everyone can use it as they want. Not on iphone though.

As for the dynamic island/pill cut out I love it. So much better than the notch. Compared to the hole cutout in android‚Äôs yes it‚Äôs bigger but I don‚Äôt mind it, especially how Apple has utilized it. Most YouTube videos are bezeled before the island until you use zoom to fill.

1. At some point you kinda forget that it‚Äôs there and you get used to it, it‚Äôs not such a big deal, for me anyway
2. There is some getting used to, the transition was easy I just had to reinstall a couple of the apps that I‚Äôm not sure why they did not transfer directly. It‚Äôs gonna sound weird but there are small things that I miss that I did not realise I will - for example being able to see the notification icons in the status bar, I really don‚Äôt like how the notifications work on iOS.

The dynamic island when watching some wider videos is a little bit annoying compared to a small punch out, but it‚Äôs fine. You barely notice it. 

The battery life is WAY better. I was on a S21, where on heavy use days, I would for sure have to charge my phone in the evening or else it would die. There is no way I would have gone to sleep with a <10% charge because my S21 would die overnight and I‚Äôd miss my alarm. The iPhone has enough battery to last more than a full day, and maybe only discharge 1% overnight unplugged. 

Things run overall smoother. I already had AirPods before the iPhone. The integration is much nicer. 

Face ID > fingerprint 

You lose a ton of customization on iOS. I miss being able to resize widgets. I miss icon swipe functions that I had set up on Nova launcher. I used to use a GPS spoofer on my Galaxy phone to be able to trick certain apps that you can‚Äôt do on iOS. Sideloading is possible on iOS, but is a PITA, whereas on Android it‚Äôs dead simple. 

Notifications are better on Android. 

In the end, both iOS and Android have some things that are done better or worse. Both Samsung/Google and Apple make great phones and software.

Also I wish the plus had the pro motion display but after a bit of reading it seems people get used to it after a day and it‚Äôs not a major concern",7,0,2,iphone15,16sz3tj,12,38,2023-09-26 21:34:06,Top

The camera is nearly as good as the pro (mainly just lacking additional zoom but I find the 2x is perfect for my needs).

I know it's lacking ProMotion and telephoto camera. But honestly. ProMotion on iPhone has been inconsistent and stuttery anyway. I might miss the telephoto a little bit, but I guess 2x is good enough for portrait photos.

The positive things on the other hand. Much MUCH better battery life! It's slightly cheaper. Seemingly doesn't overheat like the 15 Pro. It only weigh 14 grams more, despite being much larger. So it will feel super light and comfortable for the size.",6,0,2,iphone15,16sz3tj,12,38,2023-09-26 20:50:13,Top

5318,Will 128gb be enough for casual use?,k3upz0w,Holla_99,"256GB is always the safer bet especially if you plan on keeping the phone for several years. I‚Äôve made the mistake several times in the past where I got the smallest available storage cause at the time it sounded like plenty (I also had a extremely limited budget at the time unlike this year). After a good few years that minimum storage is usually not enough anymore and I have to sacrifice a good bit of content I wish I had on my phone.    
    
That being said it really does depend on your use. My Mom and I both came from older 64GB phones both are casual users I just have more content. She had used approx. 20-30GB on her old phone max. While I knew I had surpassed its storage as I had to take my complete music collection off the phone so it wasn‚Äôt full. She got a 128GB 15 Plus and has tons of space and I got the 256GB. Turns out my content takes up just a bit over the 64GB that my old phone was so 256 seems overkill right now but since I want to keep this phone for at least 5 years or more I feel safer about getting 256.    
    
If you are on a tight budget then you can probably get away with 128GB but it will become very frustrating if you ever do run out of storage. If you want to future proof and be on the safe side and can afford it definitely get 256.",1,0,2,iphone15,171wbc3,26,73,2023-10-07 13:57:46,Top

The only heating incident I had was on the first day I owned it and I had plugged it in to charge. I know it is normal for it to get warm when fast charging, but the amount of heat it had generated was way more than just simply warm. I‚Äôm surprised it didn‚Äôt shut itself off because it was almost as hot as a literal fireball. Despite that, I didn‚Äôt think too much of it because I know when you set up a new device, it has to do some indexing in the background and download stuff from iCloud which I know can cause your device to heat and it drains battery faster. Thankfully, that process is temporary. Aside from that, I haven‚Äôt had any heating issues since then. I charged it last night and while it was expectedly warm from fast charging, it definitely didn‚Äôt get nowhere near as hot as it did the first night when I was charging it.

5497,"Does anybody think the Always-On Display and Telephoto lense are worth an extra $350 between the 15+ and 15PM? (Canadian dollars, already includes tax)",k4nxaq4,TwoCables_from_OCN,"Hell no. $350 is not worth it for these 2 features, unless $350 is like pocket change for you. Y'know?

Can you do a trade-in to significantly reduce the cost? I got a $700 trade-in with my carrier (Xfinity) for my iPhone 11 and Always On Display is one of the reasons why I chose iPhone 15 Pro over the 15. The other is ProMotion because it makes all movement butter-smooth and I just ***love*** it. If I were paying full price though, then I'd still have iPhone 11. Or if my trade-in were like say *half* as much, then I would've had to settle for the 15 and I wouldn't have felt comfortable playing with the Pro model at the Apple Store because then I'd have found out what I couldn't have. Once I tried the Pro model, I immediately decided there was no way I would go back to considering the 15.

Anyway, I ***love*** Always On Display. I've been using Tap to Wake since September 2019, and so I'm extremely happy to finally put that to an end. Now my Lock Screen is always ***glanceable***! To decide if it's worth $350 more to you just to have this and a Telephoto camera, pay attention to how often you wake your phone just to see the Lock Screen and consider whether not having to do that would be worth $350 extra, and also pay attention to how often you'd strongly prefer to zoom in with an actual Telephoto camera to get true optical zooming up to 5x. These 2 things would most definitely not be worth it for me. $350 is a ton of money to me. I think these 2 things would be worth about $50 more though. For sure. Or maybe $100 more.

Also consider how important photo and video quality is to you though. I've seen people say that they think there's an obvious difference between a photo and video taken with a 15 vs. a 15 Pro. Just at 1x! For some reason I didn't test the cameras at the store.

These aren't the only differences to consider of course. The Pro models have the Action Button, which I love: [https://www.phonetui.com/2023/10/iphone-action-button-on-iphone-15-pro.html](https://www.phonetui.com/2023/10/iphone-action-button-on-iphone-15-pro.html) I just use it for the Flashlight though because with how I use my iPhone, this is what I decided I want the Action Button to do, but knowing what else it can do thanks to this article and video adds a ton of value to this phone for me. Even so, just being able to reliably turn the flashlight on and off is a big upgrade for me. Have you ever had a failed on or off for the flashlight from the Lock Screen? It was a frustratingly daily occurrence for me. It wasn't reliable.

Another thing to consider is whether you'd want the ability to do professional-level editing of your photos and videos thanks to ProRAW and Apple ProRes. To some people, this is worth the higher cost of the Pro series all by itself. Not for me though. However, this combined with the superior camera system is the main contributing factor to the higher cost. I think in addition to that the build quality is up there in the ""major contributing factor"" category. I don't think Always On Display and a Telephoto camera really adds to the cost so much that it's $350 more just for those 2 things! Or maybe the Telephoto camera does add a significant amount to the cost but I think the $350 difference is largely due to ProRAW, ProRes, and just the generally how much better the photo and video quality is and the build quality of the phone.

So yeah, I think it would be unwise to pay $350 more just to have Always On Display and a Telephoto camera unless you'd value those so highly that you'd never regret paying that much more just to have those 2 features while possibly not caring about all the others.",6,0,1,iphone15,176ouob,6,21,2023-10-13 04:24:14,Top

For me, AOD, the telephoto lens, extra RAM, 120Hz display, 256gb starting storage, better camera hardware and software, newer processor, faster USB-C speeds, the action button, and new build quality were worth the extra. 

Those two features alone make it tougher to justify the $350 CAD expense. However, you have to see if the other differences add up and make sense, especially with your budget/wallet in mind. 

If the other features make sense for you, then I'd go for the Pro Max. If not, then the Plus is the way to go. 

Can't go wrong with the Plus because it has tons of good features, like the best battery life on any 15 series iPhone, a 2x optical zoom without the need of a telephoto lens, good camera upgrades from prior models, dynamic island, super bright display to see outside, etc.",2,0,0,iphone15,176ouob,6,21,2023-10-13 17:03:46,Top

5511,15 plus difference to 14 pro max?,k24tbxv,TPM_521,"All I‚Äôve heard about the 15 pro max overheating is purely anecdotal from a single YouTube reviewer who said it was overheating when editing video onboard, which is a super specific use case and IMO something most people probably won‚Äôt do if they‚Äôre really shooting ProRes and using the footage for professional purposes since editing is SO much easier and faster on a desktop/laptop computer.

I think it‚Äôs almost always worth getting the latest gem when you upgrade. I just upgraded from an X to a 15 Pro Max. Any savings you may get buying a 14 right now will be offset in the relative loss you‚Äôll see when trading in your phone.

Plus, USB-C will future proof you for several years. You kept an iPhone 8 for this long, you‚Äôll be keeping your next phone for a while too, I‚Äôd imagine- and by then I can basically guarantee you that most of you peripherals and day to day accessories will be on USB-C. It will be convenient to have that usability with your phone as well.

I have had no issues with my phone personally- I‚Äôve only had it since yesterday evening so I can‚Äôt really say I‚Äôve put it through the ringer but it‚Äôs more than capable of handling day to day activities. Unless you‚Äôre gaming or doing other very CPU-heavy tasks like editing videos on your phone, I can‚Äôt imagine the overheating issue will ever present itself to you.",6,0,0,iphone15,16rmxrw,5,9,2023-09-25 13:28:08,Top

Whether to choose the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max depends on your personal preferences and needs.

The main differences between the two models are the size of the display and the battery life. The iPhone 15 Pro Max has a larger display and a longer battery life than the iPhone 15 Pro. If you prefer a larger display and a longer battery life, then the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the better choice.

However, if you are looking for a more compact phone or if you are on a budget, then the iPhone 15 Pro is still a great option. It has the same powerful A17 Bionic chip and the same camera system as the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

Ultimately, the best way to decide which phone is right for you is to try them both out and see which one you prefer.

I thought I would miss the 120 Hz display, the Pro‚Äôs camera system‚Ä¶ but I actually find myself surprised I was even so bothered with it. 

For the added battery life, barely any heat, I don‚Äôt see myself envy those with a Pro model again. 

Sometimes less is more, and having all those zoom options did confuse me a bit at times. I am pleased with x1 & x2 zoom which comes with the base models. I spend less time worrying about what angle and zoom is the best for the scene, and take more images, which I can crop in with the 24MP final image. 

I haven‚Äôt really suffered a downgrade to 60 Hz display either, which I was most concerned about. In fact, the only place it is noticeable is app transitions (open/close) and swiping between app pages. It‚Äôs very easy to get used to, to my surprise. 

I gotta say, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be looking for a Pro model again unless there is a significant attention to the weight (weight balance) of the devices, as I find the cameras to weigh it down a lot, particularly when crammed into a smaller Pro shape. The larger Pro Max have always some how felt lighter in the hand, due to its wider weight distribution.

Anyhow, I hope this helps you in your choice.

* A better camera system (which is saying a lot)
* A better flash for the camera, with 9 LEDs in a square, and iOS ""intelligently"" chooses the pattern based on the subject and its distance from the camera to get the best results possible with this flash
* The ProMotion display. It's an awesome luxury, making everything have a silky-smooth motion. It's a difference you wouldn't notice on other iPhones until you experience ProMotion. I remember reading about ProMotion and almost laughing saying everything moves smoothly enough for me on my iPhone 11. That may still be true but seriously, ProMotion is far better.
* An Always-On Display
* The Action Button
* A more ergonomic location of the Side Button. This might not sound like much, but if you're like me and you are usually pressing the lower part of the Side Button and if you find you accidentally take screenshots very easily, then you will ***love*** having the Side Button positioned lower. It's directly across from the Volume Down button. It's not like this on the 15 and 15 Plus!

5673,15 vs 15 Plus dilemma,k2k9fop,Holla_99,"After extensive research I went with the plus and I have no regrets. I came from an older smaller iPhone which is comparable in size the the regular 15.    
    
1. No idea how long the regular 15 lasts I know it is longer than my old phone but probably not a huge difference. Depending on use my old phone would barely make it to the end of a day on a good day or not at all on a heavier use day.    
    
2. I‚Äôve never had 120hz so I can‚Äôt really compare there but the bigger screen doesn‚Äôt make 60hz look any worse than it did on my old phone. If anything it looks even better.    
    
3. Bigger screen and much longer lasting battery is worth the $150 to me personally.    
    
4. The Plus is marginally wider and heavier than my old smaller phone so I don‚Äôt find it all that big. It is surprisingly light to hold. It‚Äôs just a fair bit taller. I also have rather small hands and adjusted to the size of the Plus easily within a day or two.    
    
5. I used my old phone without being careful of the battery health and it took over 4 years to drop below 80% at which point I was finally able to get it replaced by Apple (without Apple Care). Everyone‚Äôs use is different though. With my 15 Plus I plan on using the new 80% charge limit feature as I‚Äôm finding even just 80% of a charge can easily get me through the day and only use the included cable to charge. I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôd be able to do the same with a regular size 15.    
    
Anyways the final choice is yours of course but I figured I‚Äôd share my experience with the 15 Plus. Hopefully this helps.",6,0,1,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 11:29:18,Top

5675,15 vs 15 Plus dilemma,k2jolw2,paranoidevil,"1. Optimalized charging when is ‚Äúlearned‚Äù it will complete charging at 100% and it pause charging when u charge overnight with same adapter (it takes 2 weeks to learn, when u use once 5w and then 20w it will not work very well - anyway in day it will stop at 80% when u wanna male extra charging). 

2. U can live without it, if u used 120 and 60 and both was okay u will not notice anything. I used 14 pro with 120hz and now im on 15 with 60hz and nothing special noticed. Screen size doesnt matter.

3. I think here its on u, u like more thickness but smaller or thin but bigger device? Btw apple magsafe battery pack is around 100$ (its gently to ur battery, it drain from pack and then when empty from phone, not charging as other powerbanks) so here is difference the 50$.

4. If u think about 50$ extra spent is much, even with apple care u will need pay for repairs but not full price - as i read here (not my personal experience). Also cant say durability, i have mine 6 days but im with case. I think for u will be better just go with case and glass (even thin trasparent will help) but its my option. 

5. I heard about if it drops below 80% before device is year old, its on warranty (faulty). Im charging wireless with 10w overnight with optimalized charging on and my 13 mini was after year 99% health (11 pro after 18 months 96%, same charger). So if u will charge wireless overnight with like 5-10w its okay (better than 20w in day - my mothers iphone 13 which was charger like that was 95% after 10months and she use phone less than me). Also cant say if they replace with apple care (i cant have, my country doesnt support it - only resellers and it like 200$/year). 

So solution can be for u just buy 15 where u can return (i think directly from apple then), and if u will be unhappy just return and bring 15 plus? I see u care about phone size, so it can be solution. Hope this helped.
My 15 got 8,5hours screen on with 25% left (saving mode on, background app refresh off).",4,0,2,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 07:11:58,Top

What I DID notice is Reddit and possibly Facebook being open, even if I‚Äôm not actively on them, seem to cause the battery to drain quicker. I tried to force myself to remember to shut them completely down when I wasn‚Äôt actively on them. 
I will say I was busy at work and I‚Äôm in school at night so I may not have been quite as active on the phone as I could be so that may have been a fluke. 

I‚Äôm at 58% right now. After using the phone this morning (social media and email check ins lol ) and having it on the car charger on my way in to work this morning. 

I can‚Äôt speak to the size between the two. The plus phones are just too big for me. I prefer the smaller ones. Good luck on your decision!",1,0,0,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 12:51:32,Top

If you‚Äôre someone who would value the 120 Hz display, then it might be worth it to you.

The second is the camera. The 15 Pro camera is far superior to the 15 camera. If you take mostly snapshots, then the 15 has a great camera.  If you‚Äôre into serious photography on your iPhone, then you want the Pro.

Don't forger your new products related to a new phone : case, screens protector and probably new or more USB-C cables for home, car, work, etc.
