Anyway, yeah spend some time at an Apple Store and you'll see how poorly some people treat the display models. I'm not surprised some of them are scratched up. Think about this too: each iPhone is handled by tons of people every day, and at minimum *some* of those people aren't careful at all because of the attitude that it's not ***their*** iPhone ""so who cares?!""

35,18W Charger for iPhone 15 Plus,kcs3e38,TwoCables_from_OCN,"The person at T-Mobile doesn't have any knowledge (which isn't a surprise). So yes, it's safe. It's electrically the same, it just has a different wattage capacity to supply to the iPhone.

Also, it's not a charger. It's a power adapter. More accurately, it's a power **supply**. The charger is inside of the iPhone. It has always been this way. The iPhone 15 Plus's charger peaks at 25-27W (I've seen people say 25W and I've seen people say 27W, so I'm going to say 25-27W). So this means your iPhone's charger will never get any more than 18W for charging which is just fine. It also means you could use a 30W power adapter or an even bigger one and it would ***still*** only go as high as 25-27W.

Generally, never ask mobile service provider employees technical questions like this. It's always best to just do the research on your own and just let them handle questions like details about the mobile plans.",2,0,iphone15,18f6bvt,1,1,2023-12-10 16:21:24,Top

142,Camera quality,kcn1frr,InevitableNo90,"OP!  I get you!   I completely agree and understand with what you are talking about.  Most people like better photo quality, but the problem is, as your camera gets better, you have to improve your photography skills, or you will capture every blemish and issue in a photograph.   

Unfortunately, you‚Äôre probably gonna have to learn to edit your photos and smooth them out.   Broadcasters, news casters photographers etc have all encountered the same issue and problem as camera and video technology has improved across the board, screens have improved.  Now you see blemishes and detail that you didn‚Äôt want to see and you lose the unintended but beneficial bokeh effect of a poor camera that now can capture an entire image blemishes and background and all.

You‚Äôre gonna have to do a few things to compensate
1.  There‚Äôs not really a way to ‚Äúdumb down‚Äù the camera so to speak.  
2.  Get a free program like snapseed and edit your photo with the ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù editing option.  
3. There are portrait editors that will remove blemishes 
4.darken your exposures
5, pay attention too your backgrounds and what‚Äôs in the background when snapping the photo.

Practice and play around with the camera settings. Also don‚Äôt take pictures of ugly people with blemishes.  Photograph gorgeous people only.  That helps a lot too!  Works for me!",1,0,iphone15,18e7k8n,0,13,2023-12-09 15:12:54,Top

if i recall correctly, ever since the 14 lineup, there is some sort of extreme sharpening, and selfies might look unflattering and ""pore revealing"".

on the other scale,  android phone especially from the asian markets, that prefer to give faces a ""clay-like"" smooth face effect.

it might help to edit the picture and lower the sharpness/defenition/contrast/increat brightness etc...

It just takes 5 minutes to google the difference between the different models of the 15 series and apple has even made a simple ui comparison page on its website for simple minded people folks as well. From this you can deduce if you want those features or not and if you want to pay the price for the same. They have also included battery times too.
If you cant do such simple things why do you even exist ? 

People stop spoon feeding such idiots. And prevent reddit from being spammed with people who wants everything put into their mouths

233,Sticky iphone 15 power button,kcc7zpd,TwoCables_from_OCN,"Give the button a paper towel sponge bath. I'm serious: fold a paper towel into a small square or rectangle, soak it with water, and then squeeze out most of it while leaving about 25% of the water behind.

With the button facing up, start gently squeezing the water in very small amounts, pretending you are shrunk down to such a small size that you'd be about as tall as the button if you were standing on the iPhone next to the button. Imagine you're down there directing what's happening and that you need just enough water to go in and around the button area but nowhere else if possible. Press the button through the paper towel ""sponge"" many many times to help work the goo loose and to wash it away with this paper towel sponge bath. As such, press it a few times, flip the ""sponge"" over, press it a few times, change how it's folded to get a clean spot, press it a few times, etc. Imagine that when you press, the goo gets diluted and cleaned away and it dirties the paper towel.

To dry, press and hold with a dry paper towel or clean absorbent cloth. Blow into the button hard to get any excess water that might be in there. After blowing, you might see a little more water come out, so of course just dry it up.

If it's just a sugary substance, this will work beautifully. I am speaking from experience. It won't hurt your iPhone if you do it this way.

I came up with the idea when I envisioned simply putting the button under running water, but of course I had to figure out how to do it ***safely***. This is how, and you don't have to go anywhere to have it done (not to mention waiting for a tech to get around to ***your*** iPhone).",1,0,iphone15,18cpmp0,2,4,2023-12-07 07:19:20,Top

273,iPhone 15 base vs. 15 pro - photo resolution and storage data?,kcbf93f,flowinginthewin,"The regular 15 should be enough. The 2x ''zoom'' is fine for 99% of scenarios. However, the lack of zoom will affect quality for let's say 5x shots. Pictures will lack details on non-Pro. Fast forward 3 years from now when that kid will be in school : do you care about not getting better quality shots for let's say sports event, plays, beach, vacation, or whatever school events he's in? It's marginal scenario's and for 99% of shots the regular should be fine and still okay at 5x, but you got to think about it. Plus, the Pro gives you extra zoom for video recording : 9x VS 6x for the regular, with better quality too because of the lenses. 

If you want to takes lots of photos and video, I would definitely go for the 256Gb storage just to be safe and store those videos as well. 

In term of storage, Apple says that a 24MP photo should be on average 3Mb, while a 12MP one should be  on average 2Mb. So, 1Gb can give you 334 24MP photos or 500 12MP photos on average. There is no difference between the Pro and regular 15's in term of space taken by photos. What matters is the details. Taking pictures of trees with lots of leaves takes more storage than a restaurant menu.  

Higher resolution should not be a factor when printing photos for books since they are small. It's only a factor if you watch them on TV or PC screen. You don't notice it if you scroll to your photo library on phone and I disabled it for that reason. 

As for the 14 Pro, it's basically the same as 15 Pro (excluding the Max models), but it's locked at 12 MP. 24MP is not possible. It's a safe option because of the zoom lenses. Again, no differences in picture size (if comparing both 12MP shots). It's the content that matters. Pictures should be on average 2Mb too.",1,0,iphone15,18cbjfi,5,4,2023-12-07 02:46:07,Top

595,My iPhone takes time to turn on when I press the power button,kbnv14o,TwoCables_from_OCN,"It's not happening to me, but if it were, I'd try these things:

1. Restart (so do ""Slide to power off"" or just ask Siri to turn off your iPhone)
2. Restart this way:
   1. Press the Volume Up button one time
   2. Press the Volume Down button one time
   3. Hold the Side Button until the display goes black. Release the Side Button and simply wait for the iPhone to restart.
3. Do an iPhone Restore:
   1. Do an iCloud Backup
   2. Connect the iPhone to a computer, PC or Mac.
      1. If a PC, then use iTunes for Windows or use Apple Devices Preview, both available in Microsoft Store.
      2. If a Mac, then use Finder
   3. Click your iPhone in iTunes/Apple Devices Preview/Finder (whichever the case may be)
   4. For good measure, back up your iPhone to the computer
   5. After that, click ""iPhone Restore"" and ignore the message about backing up because you already did.
   6. It will download iOS 17.1.2 and set your phone back to the way it was the day you unboxed it (but with iOS 17.1.2)
   7. When you see Quick Start, tap ""Set Up Without Another Device"" at the bottom
   8. It will go through the initial setup steps (like basic settings and Face ID, Apple Pay, etc.) and eventually it will give you the chance to restore the iCloud Backup. So of course, restore it, wait for it to download it, and then you will be able to go back to using your iPhone the way it was before you started this.

So this just means you start by restarting. Failing that, try the different kind of a restart that takes more steps to complete. Failing that, do an iPhone Restore.

If I have my 15 Plus on a fast charger (USB-C with Power Delivery) the phone will heat up and will get pretty warm. Never enough to be uncomfortable to hold, though.

Constant over-exposure to heat will diminish the lifespan of the battery. This is why I still use the 5W Apple power adapter with a USB-A to USB-C cable overnight. I only use fast charging when I need some extra juice. 

If your phone gets uncomfortably hot while charging, to the point where you can't hold it, that's not normal. Getting warm and feeling some heat is normal though.

Just my two cents. Hope this helped.",1,0,iphone15,188eq9s,4,1,2023-12-01 16:27:46,Top

The 15 plus is actually a great phone. Extremely lightweight (lighter than the smaller 14 pro) while boosting the same screen size and comparable battery duration of the pro max. The new color infused back adds an additional premium feeling to it, essentially feeling like a pro model with an aluminum frame. 

Both come with usb-c and new form factors that make the device SOOOOO much more comfortable to hold without a case. The color options will honestly sway you which way to go. The Natural Titanium gives me that grayish-taupe vibe and was a hit with me off rip. The color choices for the 15 plus‚Äô are actually a hit with me as well.

The gist of how to get started is: zoom in and then tap the moon and then take the photo. Hold the iPhone as steady as you can throughout all of this. By tapping the moon, you're telling the camera what to focus on. Yes, you still want to reduce the exposure almost all the way down, but you have to tell the camera to focus on the moon.

So by doing this, you're telling the camera app where to prioritize the focus. This is why you have to hold as steady as you can because you have to keep the moon in the same place where you tapped.

It's not all about the display. My battery just drains and drains overnight, even when I activate LPM in Sleep Focus.

For the record, I'm not saying I need to charge it multiple times daily, but I'm not a super heavy user. If I were, I would. I don't know if this is an iOS 17 thing or the fact that I have a smaller phone now.

But before I had the 13 Pro Max, I had a 13 Pro regular, and it seemed fine. So maybe this is an iOS 17 thing.",10,1,iphone15,184ee7l,12,27,2023-11-26 16:36:40,Top

When I got it, I did the direct phone-to-phone transfer and then as I began living with it, it would get warm for things my iPhone 11 ***never*** got warm for. For example: a few hours of listening to SiriusXM. Just little things like that.

So then just to see what would happen, I did an iCloud Backup, then I did an iPhone Restore and then I restored from that iCloud Backup and ever since then it no longer gets warm for things that never made my iPhone 11 warm! So yeah, I'm very happy.

Just to be clear: I have absolutely no complaints or problems with my 15 Pro. So if you have any questions in mind like ""but do you have any problems with ***this*** aspect?"", I can guarantee you the answer is a big ""no"". I have no regrets!",2,0,iphone15,184ee7l,12,27,2023-11-26 19:20:47,Top

The 15 is the best value for a fresh new iPhone with so many awesome features. It has more than the others before. It has almost everything the pro has minus the 120 display, action button, third lens, and the same chip as 14 pro. 
I was going to get it because it is such a good deal but I chose the blue 15 pro 256gb since I got a lot of money for my birthday and am in a spot financially to pay the extra amount. 
15 is very future proof with the new port and the chip is going to be incredible for a long time. I hope Dynamic Island stays on phones and more developers use it. It is a very fun feature to use. 
My suggestion for buying an iPhone is get AppleCare. It is so worth it. I got the theft and loss plan cause I can‚Äôt afford to replace a 1200 dollar phone lol but the basic Apple care is also great. They will replace your battery for free once it drops below 80% capacity. 
Also for me 256gb is necessary because I love to use my camera also and take high spec pics. I also download all my music at the highest quality and several YouTube videos for when I‚Äôm out at college or running errands. It‚Äôs only an extra 100 and I highly recommend it.

Similar to you, I made switch from android & the iPhone 15 plus is my 1st iPhone & I gotta say I like it a lot more than I initially thought cuz I realized liked Samsung previously.

The camera on the regular 15 is actually really good & the usbc made it easier for the switch cuz I used my old android charger before getting a new one for my iPhone.

I heard that the only difference for the camera for the base vs pro is the extra zoom so if that‚Äôs something u want to have I‚Äôll say 15 pro over 14 pro. 

Newest model means longer support, usbc is great when coming from android, and it‚Äôs honestly a great phone.",1,0,iphone15,1831p9g,14,21,2023-11-25 05:29:10,Top

If you stare at your phone all day(7-14 hours of SoT daily), you might appreciate carrying a larger device. That said, the mini is an excellent viewing experience for anyone with average or better vision. 

Another thing is the RAM. 4GBs vs 6GB will be noticeable if you multitask a lot, use heavy apps, or expect good RAM management to excel for many years on newer versions of iOS.

I will say this, the question doesn‚Äôt contain enough detail. Without any detail, it most would choose the 15 in a heartbeat. There‚Äôs a reason that form factor is dominant. A good way to think about it is the mini targets one handed use, the standard 5.8‚Äù and 6.1‚Äù models target one and a half handed use, and the Plus and Max models target two handed use.

depends on your needs. do you care for usbc, dynamic island, slightly better performance, better camera and 2 years of extra support? if so, get the 15

if you don‚Äôt care for any of those and plan on changing your phone after 3 years anyway, the iphone 13 might bring you better value

You mentioned you like watching videos on your phone, and you plan on vlogging with it. There‚Äôs no better generation to get a 6.7‚Äù iPhone than this current one. 

- Streaming videos and using the camera will use significant battery, and **iPhone 15 Plus** has the **best battery life** out of the current lineup.

- 15 plus does not have an extra gigantic lense that will weigh down the phone, and the build of the base models are already very lightweight, especially this generation. 

- The edges of the 15s are curved compared to previous generations, which makes it significantly easier to hold.

Basically, going for the bigger size is more of a benefit in your case and gives you almost nothing to worry about.

The titanium frame isn't for improving durability; it's for making the iPhone lighter than it otherwise would be due to physics and just due to the entire iPhone having less mass overall compared to the previous Pro models. The aspect of physics is just simple: since there's less weight around the circumference of the iPhone, it feels lighter when you move it, especially any on-axis rotations in any direction. Like if you wobble it a lot.

Anyway, from what you said, I think you'd be 100% happy with the 15 Plus.

- I love the dynamic island, especially with music if I‚Äôm in another app it is so easy to control. 

- Battery life is amazing, I‚Äôm 17 so you could only imagine I‚Äôm on my phone all day. To make the battery health last long. I only charge when I‚Äôm at 1% and throughout the day I charge to 25 when I‚Äôm low. But I only really ever charge it at night

- Size is just the right size, I got the base model and I wouldn‚Äôt want anything bigger because the plus and the max are just too big for my liking. 

- Cinematic mode and just the camera in general is amazing. Me and my friends were pretending to shoot a music video and it looked so real. 

- USB C is great too as the only device left in my ecosystem that was using lighting it is just the best to plug it in whenever and wherever. 

- 5G works miles better than LTE 

Thats really it, I also got it for cheap because of this deal with T-Mobile and I ended up getting free tech21 case, apple watch se for a dollar a month, airtags, tempered glass, and a 20w power brick to go to the collection. So I do not regret this whatsoever.

1497,Iphone 15 or Pixel 7?,k9usvef,sirhc9114,"Pixel 5 to iPhone 15 here. I loved the pixel line. Had the original, pixel 2, and pixel 5. When the 6 came out I was not a fan of the design, fingerprint sensor removed, and look of the phone. I also have been a bit tired of the android look as well. Sure they can do a lot but just was getting a bit old to me. I was interested in getting an iPhone 15 but came across a promotion that let me trade in my pixel 5 for the full value of an iPhone 15 so I went with that. I had never owned an iPhone before but so far I really enjoy it. There are obviously absolutely idiotic things that iPhone just doesn‚Äôt let you do like android does but overall I have enjoyed it. You obviously would have to be willing to switch ecosystems but I think that‚Äôs what Apple really excels at compared to android or google. If not spending anything is more important to you just to get an upgrade I‚Äôd say get pixel 7 if you are really enjoying the 6. However the 6 to 7 doesn‚Äôt really seem like much of a jump of improvement. Why not go for the 8 if you really want an upgrade? Going to just a 7 for me would be a bit underwhelming. Otherwise I know you could get at least like 300 off an iPhone 15 with trading in your pixel 6 if it‚Äôs in good condition with mobile retailers",4,2,iphone15,17yow73,3,7,2023-11-19 05:08:36,Top

Then I wanted to get an iPhone 15 pro because we like that size because pixel 8 pro is like a plus. but from some reviews I saw that the regular iPhone 15 is very good, costs much less and also has many pro features. the only thing is the telephoto lens, but it does this with the 2 cameras, so you have a kind of digital extra camera. LiDAR and 120HZ doesn't matter to me. And the titanium will be much stronger, but I use a case so that doesn't make much difference. So that's why I ordered the iPhone 15 512 Gb in blue and it's great.

The base 15 is less equipped than the S21. It will be a signifiant downgrade in hardware IMO, but an upgrade in software (for the ecosystem, the rest is subjective).

No more dedicated zoom lenses, no AOD, no 90Hz+ refresh rate, no more software enabled mute mode if you go to the 15 Plus. You get those features with the 15 Pro Max. Now, they are not required for your tasks but still, they will be gone. The lack of telephoto (zoom) is probably an issue, but probably not for close up pictures like you seem to do. 

So make your choice. If you loved and used these features, they will disappear for quite some time unless you get buyer remorse and switch. Other than that, the 15 Plus can be fine.

The screen is very usable on bright sunny day and battery life is way better. The 2x is somewhat better on the 12 Pro vs 2x digital zoom on the 15. The weight is way better on the 15. The horizontal face unlock is very underrated IMO and a great feature. Dynamic Island is a goodie, but not the greatest best thing ever. Satellite and crash detection are not a factor for most people. Of course, there is USB-C. It‚Äôs a one and done troublesome situation if you have 5 lightings cable for bed, car, travel and work, but a change is inevitable. 

That‚Äôs about it.

The 12 Pro to 15 is an iPhone change that gives USB-C, a more usable screen on sunlight , better battery life, better main camera and some small software features, but comes with a little downgrade on 2x zoom details IMO.

1850,What improvements can they make now?,k93jo9x,TwoCables_from_OCN,"Maybe they will find a way to have everything for the selfie camera and Face ID be under the display so that there's nothing but display. Not even a tiny little hole. What I mean by ""find a way"" is, finding a way that satisfies their high standards.

Maybe they will also find some way to no longer need any kind of a port, like what we have now with the USB-C port. Perhaps something is coming we can't even imagine right now, something wireless like Bluetooth but better.

I'd like true wireless contactless charging somehow. Just have some sort of a Tesla-like transmitter that can charge the iPhone.

Maybe camera technology will advance so much at some point that the iPhone camera system can include a mirrorless camera.

Maybe too the camera sensor technology will advance so far that the base models will make today's Pro models very inferior in comparison.

I think it would be fun to have a thermometer on my iPhone. Of course, it would have to be some new advanced thermometer technology that would enable the user to take their iPhone out of their warm pants pocket and get an accurate air temperature reading of the air temperature ***outside*** of the pocket without having to wait for the thermometer to be cooled down or warmed up first, whatever the case might be. This imaginary high-tech thermometer would also be able to tell you the temperature of water by just putting the phone under water. I'm sure by then iPhones will be able to be truly waterproof instead of just being water *resistant*.

I think it would be cool to have true Night Vision from the camera. I know what you're thinking: today we can just use the flashlight. Hear me out though: a flashlight doesn't illuminate everything equally. It has a limited range. With true Night Vision, you could see everything in the dark equally, just like with Night Vision goggles. So then all you'd have to do is turn it on and look at everything around you right on the display.

Another scenario where I'd make use of Night Vision is if I need to see in the dark but I don't want to turn the flashlight on because even at its lowest brightness it can be too bright (where turning it off means I can't see as well as I could in the dark before turning it on). Every once in a while when I'm ready to go to sleep and I have just one light on set to 1% brightness to the color red but I need more light for a sec, I kinda hate using the flashlight even at its lowest brightness because it can be too bright. I'd love to have Night Vision so that I can just turn that on and see what I need to see without being ""blinded"" like I can be for a moment after turning the flashlight off. Plus, it's a very ""alerting"" light.

So, another thing I'd love to have is the ability to change the color of the flashlight. So in the above scenario (without Night Vision), I'd just turn on a red flashlight instead of this bright daylight blue one. So I'm imagining long-pressing the flashlight in Control Center and getting options for color in addition to brightness. That way, I'd choose the color and probably a low brightness and then I'd turn it on.

Oh hey, Night Vision photos and videos.

I got my iPhone 15 Pro from Xfinity Mobile. The day it was delivered, I turned it on and set it up and moved in. Xfinity Mobile needed to be in possession of my old iPhone within 14 days to complete the trade-in. That's far better than trying to do it all in one visit to a store.

2010,are the apple cases good?,k8w2hdw,Edge_Audio,"This is a very personal, and often heated, conversation.

Apple cases are overpriced (as with everything Apple). Now that's out of the way.

Due to a big mix up, Apple offered me some goodwill and I have a Finewoven in green, and silicone in blue, for my 15 Pro Max.

I like both of them!

After three weeks of pretty normal use (not pampering), the Finewoven still looks new. I use a magsafe charger every night and in the car. It's made a slight mark, but also on the leather. I like the feel, fit and finish.

The silicone case I've used for about a week. It has a nice soft feel that's still slick enough to get in and out of a pocket.

Clear case - could be good, I don't have an opinion since I haven't used them. I've heard since the apple ones are hard back cases they don't stretch and hence have lower shock obsorbsion. And also they seem to lack cover / protection at teh bottom

I agree with others in that it‚Äôs a little tight/too hard in that it‚Äôll crack in the bottom corners bc it‚Äôs hard plastic, but I paid a fraction of the price of a new clear case that I was fine with the cracks since replacing them was so cheap for me.

* In one case, someone had a dramatic improvement by just updating iOS to the most current version
* Or maybe you're experiencing blurry photos because of the larger sensor requiring a larger distance between the camera and the subject, which gives the impression the camera is inferior.

It's also possible the iPhone XR had a worse screen so you weren't able to see all the details the iPhone 15 does.

The only way to get better selfies are by:
1. Take a burst shot (you can slide to a different frame and it‚Äôll actually look better and more realistic)
2. Take a live photo and choose a different frame as mentioned above

2)let your image process a little then go back to it after a few minutes. I found that it takes a while to get the actual coloring to set. Really weird. Almost like you‚Äôre waiting for your photos to develop. 
3.) you‚Äôll want to edit your photos. What I usually do is turn down contrast a tad, up the warmness to your liking, and if you want your pores to slightly disappear, turn up noise reduction. 

I had the X and it basically smoothened out my face. It was lower quality and has a more filtered look. Hence the jarring contrast to your new high quality camera. lol. You‚Äôll get used to your face the more you use your camera.",0,0,iphone15,17smfn7,0,10,2023-11-11 08:26:35,Top

2244,20-80 Rule for Charging iPhone 15 Pro and AppleWatch Ultra 2,k8j5jsb,TwoCables_from_OCN,"I think it's stupid. The battery is there for you to enjoy your iPhone. It's a consumable/replaceable part. Why reduce the quality of your iPhone experience by effectively shrinking the size of your battery due to never charging past 80% and never letting it drop below 20%? So that it might last a few weeks longer before you have to replace it? smh

Also: if you never deviate from 20-80%, you battery level readings and Maximum Capacity estimate will get less and less and less accurate. This is why using the 80% Limit setting still allows the battery to be charged to 100% on occasion, and this is why it's good to recalibrate the battery 2-3 times per year by doing at least one cycle of 0 to 100%.

People worry too much about their battery.

I think it's like worrying about the tires on your car so much that you compromise the way you drive just so your tires last a little longer.",5,0,iphone15,17rcovd,8,21,2023-11-09 18:05:01,Top

The battery does get worse with time, battery health is a thing but is not as drastic as people make it look, by the time you feel that your battery is not lasting long enough there is a huge chance that your battery drain is happening because you have so many apps with permissions like background app refresh, push notifications, location services, tracking, etc, and not because your battery has lost most of its juice due to battery degradation, you will probably switch to a new phone before the battery health gets under 80% making the cap useless.

I‚Äôm using the 80% cap myself only because I have a charger at home, at my car, at the office and I never run out of juice during the day with 80% battery, otherwise I would not be capping it if I really needed that 20% so don‚Äôt stressing yourself, if you need the 100% battery then use it, it won‚Äôt degrade fast enough that you would regret it in the long run.",1,0,iphone15,17rcovd,8,21,2023-11-20 13:01:20,Top

High quality photos probably means 48MP pictures that can take up to 5Mb (low details) to let‚Äôs say 18Mb (high details like trees at fall season). It will fill up fast, not mentioning 4K videos.

I never delete pictures and I always compress them, thus my storage filling rate is not high so 128gb is enough for me.

- good camera 
- ‚Äúit just works‚Äù

cons
- limited customisation
- lack of 120hz? (depends if it‚Äôs a deal breaker)
- usb-c is still on usb-2 (depends if it‚Äôs a deal breaker)
- it‚Äôs a boring phone (can be a good or bad thing depending on the person)
- can‚Äôt sideload apps 

iphone is reliable if all you to is to text, call, watch videos or take pictures. Things like customisation and freedom to modify your phone will be limited through. 

I suggest you invest in a good case for your phone to protect it from drops

you can use non-apple accessories like Belkin and Anker. I don‚Äôt recommend using knock-offs",5,1,iphone15,17qoj5t,5,6,2023-11-08 21:24:34,Top

I'm debating on doing exactly the same thing. I got the 7 about 5 years ago, not when it first came out, but there are little signs that it might be a good idea to get a new phone. I've never had the most current version of a phone so It thought it might make sense this time around with the power plug change.  I do like the smaller body of the 7 but figure I'll get used to something a little bigger (not getting the Max).

2612,is the Red Pocket deal better compared to AT&T and Verizon? https://www.redpocket.com/shop/iphone/apple-iphone-15-pro,k81j1ac,i_speak_the_truf,"Red Pocket is going to be a better deal simply because their service is much cheaper.  Their plans start at $10 a month  including $40 for unlimited data (I think on ATT's network).  

The ATT and Verizon deals lock you in to a device payment plan (and thus $90+ service) for three years.  The best deal from the major carriers right now is probably T-Mobile who tends to have slightly cheaper plans and has you pay off the phone (with trade-in credits) over two years.  Depending on your current carrier, you can get really aggressive with T-Mobile promotions, for me switching from Xfinity, they paid off my 14 Pro balance ($400), offered me $200 credit per line to switch, and gave me $830 in credits over two years with a trade-in.  Also the trade-in doesn't have to be unlocked so you can buy an iPhone SE from WalMart for $150 and trade it in, then sell your (ideally more valuable) existing iPhone on eBay.  Some of the folks on /r/tmobile had also reported buying a Galaxy S9 for $70 on eBay and trading that in for the $830 promotion.

Red Pocket's deal is also better because they give you the full rebate after three months of service.  This is what Xfinity used to do and it was a great deal because you could get a new phone every year for basically free.   The $300 is close to how much an iPhone depreciates over a year so you can pay off your phone at any time, get it unlocked, then sell it on eBay/Swappa when the new phone comes out.  I did this on Xfinity for three years going from  an iPhone 12 Mini to a 13 Pro to a 14 Pro paying nothing out of pocket (except with the 14 Pro they finally forced the rebates over a payment plan like the other carriers do).",2,0,iphone15,17nekq2,2,1,2023-11-06 07:22:39,Top

2675,Iphone 15 or go pro?,k7oqkel,Comfortable-Basil-47,"I upgraded from the iPhone 11 to the 15 pro. 

I'll be honest, it was a more of a pity upgrade. I really think next year will have the big changes such as the iPhone 16 ultra and the smaller pro getting the same zoom lens as the 15PM but I really needed to trade-in my iPhone 11 so my trade-in value with my carrier didn't tank.

After watching all the reviews on Youtube, I concluded that the 15 pro was the worst of the entire lineup because of the worst battery. Why did I get it? I just really wanted the 8gb of ram and the smaller form factor. I didn't care about the 120Hz or the action button.

But now having it in my hand, wow. I never knew AOD would be helpful as much as I thought. I don't use it the entire night hooked to a stand or anything but use it for only a couple minutes such as in the morning before heading to class or when I don't have time to actually pickup my phone to check the time(I assume this wouldn't be a problem if you have an apple watch)

The action button was a neat addition and I find it way more useful than the silent switch. You can map multiple actions to the button with some shortcut tricks so I can toggle AOD, set Airdrop to everyone for 10 min, shazam a song, and still keep it as a silent switch. 

Battery life has actually surprised me. It's about the same battery life on 5G and might be slightly better than my iPhone 11 with 4G/LTE. It does get warmer than I would like but I'm hoping it gets better with better optimization for the apps I use in the future. 

TLDR: Get the 15 pro. There's a lot of nice QOL changes that make a big difference. If you can hold it for another year and don't care about trade-ins like I do, get the iPhone 15 now or 16/16 pro next year.

2768,Is it better for me to choose 15 Plus or Pro?,k7ctzx0,xroalx,"Coming from S23, I've had a similar dilemma, except it was 15 vs 15 Pro for me. The Plus/Max is too big for my liking.

After a long time of debating and thinking, the Pro does not really offer that much for the added price tag and comes with a slightly worse battery than the base 15.

The 120 Hz display, well, I've had that on the S23, but don't miss it at all on my base 15. Always on, haven't used it on my S23 either, faster data transfers over USB are also not worth it as I'm using Cloud/AirDrop anyway, not cables.

There's the 3x camera, which the S23 has as well, but I used it so rarely and my pictures consist of shooting something when traveling and never looking back at it, it's not worth it.

The only other thing is the action button which I imagine I'd play around with for a while and then set some mundane thing to it anyways and almost forget it's a thing.

Those things alone aren't worth the extra price, weight, and slightly worse battery.

I second what others said, go with the Plus, unless you want to do ""professional"" photography with your phone. You're not missing anything.",25,2,iphone15,17l9zhf,19,43,2023-11-01 12:25:27,Top

When you search iPhone X into google, The first result from [Apple.com](https://Apple.com) says "" Sep 12, 2017 ‚Äî Apple announces *iPhone X*, the future of the smartphone,...

And for the pro you get ""Gigablast your gigabits. ... *iPhone 15 Pro* is the first iPhone to support USB 3, for a huge leap in data transfer speeds and faster pro workflows than ever before¬†... ""

Notice how they say ""future of the smartphone"" for the iPhone X and just talk about specs of the iPhone for the others. They've essentially built the iPhone 15 and the 11-14 based on the X.

No room for let's say put some app on vibrations-only even if it's not on mute and when it's not on mute, you can't set up custom notification sound for apps, so a weather notification, random text message and game notification sounds all the same. 

With the 15 Pro, you can at least set up automations that activate vibration mode for certains focus, time of day, locations and Bluetooth devices. You can't on all other iPhone because of the mute switch even if can be bypassed by software, like the emergency bypass on the contact/phone app. 

It's a dated ''feature'' that people seem to love, but don't use it. I feel like it gives them a feeling of safety, because it's in mute mode with a switch, it's in mute mode for good, like a circuit breaker.

3129,iPhone 15PM speaker issue,kbbvhzk,SimoGe83,"Hi!

some days ago I received my 4th iPhone 15 Pro from Amazon...yes, the fourth replacement.

The first one was afflicted by the well-known overheating, so much that it couldn't be held against the cheek during a call... the update didn't solve the issue.

The second device, at maximum volume, emitted a very annoying buzz from speakers during phone calls due to some internal vibration... in exchange for the ‚Ç¨1369 I paid, I expected a device without defects.

Then the third iPhone arrived: the problems with the speakerphones were identical to the second: a buzz appeared while calling, using the speakers as loudspeaker. 

I sent that iPhone back to Amazon and I bought another one...nothing changed also with the fourth device.

There's not too many settings I need to change and my overall experience with any kind of transfer or restore is that things get messed up every single time and then I feel like I've just made a mess I'm never going to clean up.

Maybe it's just Android in the past being not good at this, maybe it's just a feeling, but it never bothered me to set up my device fresh.

You don't lose much time in getting things back since Messages are stored in iCloud and will sync, email too. Passwords, like you note, in Keychain. Make sure you've stored full res photos in iCloud. 

The main time sink is if you're very particular about how you home screen and others are arranged (and that's where the screenshot would be nice I guess).

So with the first option you will use the full capacity for at least some time, with the second option you will never use the full capacity.

In those scenarios maxing to 100% for long periods is not good. 

For typical users that charge at night and then off a charger all day predictably optimized charging works great. The algorithm doesn‚Äôt handle unpredictable charging scenarios very well. 

Truth is these are small batteries and the cost to replace over three years is very small. Lithium batteries hate extremes (extreme heat, cold, max charge, max discharge).

Was contemplating between 15 and 15+
I chose 15+ because of:
1. Battery life. 
Absolute beast. Finished my first day of using the phone with 70% left. Can easily last 2 days of moderate use. 1 day for heavy usage. Even now im on 91% at 3pm from 100% at 8am
2. Battery life longevity.
I used the xr for about 4 years now and honestly only in the 1st year did it last the whole day. So by my logic if the 15+ can last a 1-2 days then in the long term at least i can use it one whole day.
3. Dynamic island placement.
Iphone 15‚Äôs dynamic island i feel protrudes more on the screen compared to my xr as the placement is a bit lower. It‚Äôs minute but i noticed it. For the 15 + you get the whole xr screen plus more and the dynamic island is up there. Plus it looks smaller on a bigger screen.

3493,Which leather case is slimmer?,k6ig431,matt_hipntechy,"I'm also in the process of looking for an iPhone 15 leather case. Here's my options and how I evaluated them:

* **Mujjo**: At first glance it looks good, but I don't like the big ""Mujjo"" brand at the back of the case. Also, I have read about many people returning it because it didn't meet their expectations. 
* **Nomad**: I've used a Nomad leather case on my iPhone 12 mini. It's good quality and offers high protection. But it adds more weight and bulk compared to the Apple leather case and the plastic material on the sides doesn't feel as nice in the hands as leather. I'd skip this.
* **Bullstrap**: Looks nice but I don't like the open bottom and at $89 it's too expensive.
* **LONLI**: A decent looking and inexpensive option on Amazon that still seems to offer high quality leather and no branding at all. People seem very happy with it based on reviews. However, on the images it looks thicker and heavier than other options.
* **Andar**: To me it looks quite slim, checks all the boxes and is reasonably priced. I believe this is the closest to the Apple leather case and likely the one people like you and I should get. However, it's pre-order right now and will ship mid November.",2,1,iphone15,17gr1g5,7,6,2023-10-26 08:25:45,Top

3556,"For this 15 that i got last week, isn‚Äôt the cycle count too high?",k6mq1v2,TwoCables_from_OCN,"Stop worrying about it. Stop looking at this. The way you use your iPhone determines how quickly you will go through charge cycles. The only way you can slow this down is by using your iPhone less.

Here's how it works: if you were to charge from 50% to 100% two times in a row, then you complete one charge cycle. Or, or if you were to charge from 25% to 100% and then you charged from 75% to 100% after that, you'd complete 1 charge cycle. I'm using simple math on purpose just to keep it easy to understand. You could do 75% to 100% 4 times in a row to complete 1 charge cycle. So you can see it just goes by math.

Here's where I confuse most people though: what I described above isn't describing TRUE charge cycles. A ***true*** charge cycle is 0% to 100% because it affects the ***entire*** battery instead of just a ***portion*** of it. All of my examples above are just portions. Even 5% to 100% is a portion, albeit a huge one.

So just stop worrying about it. Stop caring. It's just a battery. Just enjoy your iPhone! It's absolutely ***useless*** to never charge to 100%, or even to never charge to 80%. Don't you think it's inconvenient to be charging it so damn frequently? Imagine how nice it would be to ***ONLY CHARGE WHILE YOU'RE SLEEPING!*** Let it go to 100% while you're sleeping, wake up, unplug it and enjoy all-day battery life. Imagine never having to charge while you're awake.",1,0,iphone15,17gojwt,0,24,2023-10-27 02:44:21,Top

This downloads the current version of iOS, erases everything off the phone and starts it 100% fresh with a new installation of the current version of iOS. From there, it's like you just unboxed the iPhone and turned it on. So at that point, restore from iCloud.

3954,Do any of you also have ‚Äúfear of missing out‚Äù..,k3yzek2,KsnNwk,"I have no fear of missing out, I have fear of losing value.

So when you buy the newest luxury tech thing, be it car, GPU, iphone, in this example iphone.

They tend to lose most money the first year, so 2-3 months before new iphone releases, current model will lose almost 1/3 of it's value (ca 500-600‚Ç¨). Afterwards the 2nd year it only loses ca 150‚Ç¨ a year.

So going by this, it's better to go with last years model iphone when new one release or during holidays.

That way I can upgrade more often, but the urge for new shiny thing sometimes is overpowering.

I was planning to go with 14 PM when 15PM releases, it costing only 1050‚Ç¨ instead of 1550‚Ç¨. But then 15 PM has USB-C, auto portrait, better HDR, 5x zoom, Action button. All features will help me out.

So most normal people should get last years model, you will be able to upgrade sooner and lose least value.

But then I calculated the difference of price between 14PM vs 15PM, when I deduce taxes, since I get it for company. It ends up being like 300‚Ç¨ and I can get 15PM for 0% fee installments, while for 14PM I would need to shell out $. So I just got the 15PM.

You‚Äôll read about battery drain all the time when new IOS versions come out, especially major revisions.

Here‚Äôs a related thread on Macrumors. One post even has a video of the 15 Pro beating the 15 Pro Max.

Another guy did a test and did a clean install vs a migrated install. The clean install got 2 hours better battery life. 

The drain isn‚Äôt just affecting the Pro. 

I‚Äôm willing to bet a lot of the drain issues go away after a few days and/or an update comes out for iOS 17.",3,1,iphone15,16sdcis,38,152,2023-09-26 11:49:18,Top

4164,Picked up the blue iPhone 15 today as well as the blue FineWoven case. What do you think?,k2q26nu,theanimaster,"I think the fine woven case is brilliant. Here‚Äôs what no one is talking about: 
1.) Material is all the same - sides are impregnated with a grippy material. 
2.) the grippy material is nice in cases where, if you‚Äôre weird like me, you‚Äôre glued to YouTube even when taking a shower ‚Äî and the grippiness so far has been good enough to keep my iPhone on a tiled ledge ‚Äî and I sure don‚Äôt want to test rumors of the fragility of the glass on my brand new iPhone 15 Pro Max! 
3.) Did I mention it is grippy? Definitely better than my leather cases from Apple.
4.) I don‚Äôt approve of the price ‚Äî this could easily be half of what the leather ones went for. 
5.) The finish is nice. Cloth on cloth feels good in the pocket, and the texture carries through even on the grippy part. It doesn‚Äôt feel cheap at all ‚Äî you can feel the texture on the lip of the case ‚Äî cheap cases don‚Äôt have that attention to detail. You can even see the texture. But again ‚Äî it‚Äôs not just form ‚Äî the grippiness gives it function. 
6.) Action button is a PITA. I keep mistaking it for the volume up button ‚Äî but that‚Äôs not the case‚Äôs fault, and probably the reason Apple only has one operational function for the action button, and it requires a long-press. 

Overall, it‚Äôs a price gouge for a solid, functional product‚Äî but so were the previous Apple leather cases which stained like no one‚Äôs business. We have yet to see how this one holds up after a year. But I‚Äôm impressed so far. I spend more on plastic crack from the likes of Games Workshop, so, yeah.

Fortunately, Apple provides the tools at an incredible level of detail to turn ‚Äòuseless4me‚Äô features off.  The best approach is simply to go though as many settings as possible and just turn-off the crap you don‚Äôt use, don‚Äôt  care about, or are not currently using.  It‚Äôs first thing I do with a new phone, and I‚Äôve always gotten Apple‚Äôs ‚Äòup to‚Äô SOT spec, at least on wifi and running lite apps.  

FWIW, Apple also provides the tools to program your own automated custom charge optimization (via shortcuts & $10 smartplug), to maintain that efficiency for years - I personally keep my phones/batt longer than Apple will support the iOS. 

So many different preferences and use cases, combine with so many different settings, that it‚Äôs best if everyone efficiency-tunes for themselves.",3,0,iphone15,174haq0,2,5,2023-10-10 16:22:21,Top
4404,Optimisation of 15Pro,k4cr2gv,TwoCables_from_OCN,"I've tried using this phone with ProMotion turned off (Settings > Accessibility > Motion > Limit Frame Rate to **on**) and it's unpleasant. It's one of those things where, once you experience it, you don't want to *stop* experiencing it.

So there are better ways to reduce power consumption than that. Like, Auto-Brightness. Go somewhere where you can have absolutely no light whatsoever, like a room with no windows and no lights on. With Auto-Brightness turned on, set the brightness as low as it goes. This sort of ""calibrates"" Auto-Brightness in a way where from that point forward, it will always use a lower display brightness than it otherwise would if you hadn't done that.

You can always reset this by toggling Auto-Brightness off and back on.

Use Dark Mode. I don't like Dark Mode, but Dark Mode reduces power consumption because every OLED pixel is a bit like an individual incandescent light bulb, but one where the color affects power consumption in addition to its brightness: the darker the color is of a pixel, the less power that pixel consumes, and if it's black, it's simply **off!** :)

So, even at 100% brightness but nearly black, a pixel is going to consume ***significantly*** less power than it would if it were some brighter color, like ... white. At a very ***low*** brightness displaying a bright color such as white, an OLED pixel still just *sips* power, but of course it will consume far less if it were producing a **dark** color, and so that's how Dark Mode can help reduce your average power consumption. 

Keep Bluetooth off when you're not using it. Not only does this reduce power consumption, but it increases your phone's security. However, I get that for some people this is extremely inconvenient. So it's just a suggestion.

If your SIM/eSIM allows for it, go to **Settings > Cellular >** tap your SIM or eSIM > **Voice & Data**, and enable ""LTE"".  I have ""5G Auto"", ""5G On"", and ""LTE"". With ""5G Auto"", it's supposed to only use 5G when it's needed for performance  while optimizing battery life, but it uses 5G far more than I expected, like when using Google Maps for real-time navigation. smh I've never had any Google Maps performance problems with LTE. heh

Turn off 'Always On Display'. I refuse to turn this off just to make a tiny reduction in my average power consumption because I freakin' **love** this feature (it's a feature of convenience and luxury and sometimes of necessity), but it's another way you can reduce power consumption. Or, you can make a very very very minor compromise: in **Settings > Display & Brightness > Always On Display**, turn off ""Show Wallpaper"". So the wallpaper area will be black, and as you know, when an OLED pixel is black, it's off in order to be black. You can also turn off ""Show Notifications"" to further reduce power consumption of 'Always On Display'.

Even so, the refresh rate drops to 1 Hz when 'Always On Display' is in use. So when the phone is in its sleep mode while 'Always On Display' is enabled (where the display would normally just turn off - most people call this ""locked""), the refresh rate is at 1 Hz to help minimize power consumption.

There are probably lots of other things you can do to reduce your average power consumption even further, but I suspect they wouldn't make any noticeable difference.

So really, I think it's best to just enjoy it as-is!",2,1,iphone15,174haq0,2,5,2023-10-11 00:42:53,Top

Is it worth? Depends. There‚Äôs not a thing I miss about the 12 Pro besides colors. The lack of LiDAR does not influence focus of photography and the measure app still works (don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs less reliable). 

The brightness is VERY noticeable. It‚Äôs visible on sunset. It was hard on the 12 Pro.

The CPU upgrade is not noticeable.

The battery is noticeable, but I was at 92% health. But considering the 6,1‚Äù iPhones 12 lineup battery capacity was a joke (2815mAH, smaller than the 11) it‚Äôs very noticeable considering it‚Äôs now 3300+ maH.

The weight is noticeable. I like the weight loss.

The big question remains about the zoom. You loose the telephoto lenses, no matter if Apple says you get a 2x optical zoom on the 15 (you‚Äôre not : it‚Äôs digital cropping). I will say this : I tried to take the same picture that I took at 2x two years ago on my 12 Pro at around the same distance. Result : the mailbox seemed to have kinda a LITTLE more details on the 12 Pro shot. But I zoomed a lot to notice that. So have this in mind. It‚Äôs kinda equal.

The dynamic island is cute, but not a life changer.

Horizontal Face ID unlock was used quite often. It‚Äôs nice.

USB-C is a blessing and a nightmare. I had to dig my box to get USB C cables to put on my chargers. However, you can finally buy USB-C accessories.

Now, with this in mind, you can make the choice if it‚Äôs financially worth make this upgrade. Without money in mind, I would say it‚Äôs worth an upgrade. A battery swap is almost always the best option to make financially.",1,0,iphone15,16yjkbg,0,21,2023-10-03 16:36:56,Top

I'm having a dillema whether I should change my 14 pro for the newly released 15 base model. I can sell my current pro for around what the 15 costs so I most likely wouldnt lose any money in the process. Ever since I got the 14 pro Ive been bothered by its weight and clunkyness. After using in for like 5 minutes the lower half of my hand gets numb and sharp corners make it more difficult to use with one hand. Its also really heavy to carry in pockets so I pretty much completely resort to using bags now.

***Pros:***

\-much lighter phone

\-pink (I would def buy a pro model if if came in pink)

\-slightly rounded corners that make it easier to hold

\-usb c

\-new device experience

\-new battery

\-better main camera

***Cons:***

\-no 120hz display

\-no real difference in usability

\-current battery is at 98% which means its stilll very good

\-no third camera

So far for me the most important arguments for is weight and color, against is lack of 120hz. On one hand I wanna get the 15 on the other hand I dont wanna feel like im making a mistake and downgrading",1,1,iphone15,177v972,11,40,2023-10-15 08:38:09,Top

 So if you are the go, you can do ProRes Raw 4K 60fps for slow motion.

With 14 Pro, you cannot plug in a SSD, so you are stuck with only 1080p ProRes on 128GB version.

For non Pro it doesn't matter.

It's really a feature only meant for professionals who knows what they are doing and the best camera is the one you have nearby. While otherwise for professional gigs they have 2000-3000$ cameras.

4627,Is it worth it? Xiaomi vs Iphone,k9qwzxo,titiwon,"I recently bought an iphone 15 (the normal one) and swtiched from Android and I totally regret. Let me pinpoint some of the downsides I found:

1. The UI is very clunky. It does not have a backwards button. How ridiculous is to slide upwards to go to the tabs menu, or having to find backwards arrows and crosses to exit tabs or processes. Does not matter the processor, the user experience ends up being slower.
2. Android applications work worse. For example: I am an active google map user and same thing as 1st. Having to do touches slides and other things to access menus and other things difficult the usage.
3. Android applications work worse. Another example is whatsapp, be ready to loose your chats. It is so pathetic you cannot download your google drive backups. There are 3rd party softwares to bring those chats to the iphone. For that you need to allow a 3rd party to decrypt all your messages and handle your data. I would not recommend that.
4. The camera. Total dissapoinment. Main camera, In the night it underperforms with my super old xiaomi remi 8 pro. In the day, obviously way more beautiful than my redmi, but sometimes texts and other things are not so well captured. Front Camera, simply horrible, seems a bit blurry. Forget about details like hairs. Almost as bad as my redmi 8 pro.
5. Apple wants to hook you up by all means with shareabilty applications. I must say airdrop is very good, big shoutout.

tltr; IOS UI is bad and the experience is slow in spite of the processor. Camera is not that impressive (depending what kind of pictures you want). You will not be able to migrate 100% all your data and apps to IOS, be ready to leave things behind.",1,1,iphone15,173ntf4,4,10,2023-11-18 09:18:35,Top

Iphone 14 pro wont be worth getting bc u can only get 2nd hand and it will cost way more then the iphone 15, plus it will have the old charging port..

- brighter screen in sunlight 
- dynamic island

- 2x optical zoom
- automatic portrait in ""photo"" camera
- the longest support
- ""usb c"" (slower than in Pro models)

Just go with iPhone 15. If I were you I would go and use it until support end and be happy with next new iPhone after years.

iPhone 15 is something fresh for me for 3 reasons:

- design / look
- 2x optical zoom
- brighter screen

I have iPhone 12 and photos from main lens look weird and unnatural, especially it's 26mm equivalent of DSLR camera.

2x optical zoom is equivalent of 48mm that is close to the angle (50mm) that our naked eyes see.

Just wipe it down with a microfiber cloth preferably a little damp then use a dry one. If you put a case on it that will help tremendously.

Other than that, you should estimate how much storage you can reduce V.S how much storage you can gain over the next 3 years. If you calculate that you will bust 128Gb after 3 years, get 256Gb.

What worries me more is the odd change to a frame and design that allows the iPhone to bend easily, and break the glass too easily.  There's a hollow space behind the back glass that makes it easy to break...even by hand.

1- yes the island pill is annoying while watching full screen stuff. Its utility is rather limited too but it‚Äôs better than the old notch on the previous models. You aren‚Äôt really going to notice it in regular use but you will while watching content.


2- like I said it depends. What do you want from your phone? If you want the os to be smooth and reliable then ios is better. But if you want the freedom of choosing what to do with your phone then androids are wayy better. The keyboard on iPhone sucks and I‚Äôm surprised you can‚Äôt change it without downloading another. You can‚Äôt move your apps on the home screen to a more reachable area. You can‚Äôt even download anything outside the app store unless you decide to sideload which is a tedious task anyway. You can‚Äôt download apks which‚Äôs the thing I missed the most but if you‚Äôre ok with these stuff then the ios will probably not be that bad for you. It will take some time to get used to tho.

3-can‚Äôt say cuz i literally came from a 4 yr old 30k phone to an 80k one. The quality is unquestionably better but idk how it compares to other flagships for same price",2,1,iphone15,17bjlhp,11,47,2023-10-19 15:50:05,Top
5094,"Considering buying, but have some concerns:",k5kbodo,QWufflez,"Honestly, think about it carefully. I just switched and there a lot of small things that really bother me. Transfer is easy, there's an app that sends over media and supposedly a list of apps. Roughly 2/3 apps showed up on iOS and we're quickly downloaded. But 1/3 I had to search and manually Install. No biggie. 
iOS feels cool, but very limited. Apple tells you how to use your device. You have to adept to their workflow design, many things can not be adjusted.
Keyboards on iOS suck. I used to have a keyboard where I could long press for symbols like question mark on certain buttons. This seems to not be possible on iOS. Also the comma key is not on main keyboard, but you have to switch via 123 button to symbols. Haven't found an option to enable dedicated @ key on main keyboard either. Swiping feels less accurate. Again, tried multiple, Gboard is my favorite so far.
Notifications on the top screen are not a thing. (Small icon of email or WhatsApp for unread notifications). Only in Lockscreen/notficaion Screen.
Control Center (swiping top right down to have quick settings, turn of wifi or so) is rather limited. Can't turn on hotspot from there, can't toggle vibration settings quickly. 
You can't move the home screen, it's always the most left screen (used to have it centered and then to the left one kind of apps, to the right other kind of apps)
Back gesture is finicky. Have to reach to the left most position, can't change it to the other side like on Android. Also some apps don't support back swiping, have to use top left corner.
The pill/island also is weird. Haven't had one before, it bothered me quite a bit. But Im getting used to it slowly. Still seems very odd they can't implement a better solution like everyone else...

Quickly to settings from anywhere (pull down and press settings)? Nope, not an option..
Those are just some, to iOS users these seem unnecessary or they didn't even think that would be possible, but that's the way I had my work flows setup. If you don't want to, you didn't have to use it Like thus. That was the beauty of android, everyone can use it as they want. Not on iphone though.

One, I went from the iPhone 6s to the Galaxy S8 then to the 11 pro (currently on the 15 plus) and when I migrated my stuff it wasn‚Äôt a huge issue. The biggest thing for me was pictures but all of them were backed up from google photos which was nice, my contacts also all transferred over as well. The majority of the stuff nowadays is cloud based so migrating from one to another isn‚Äôt terrible.

As for the dynamic island/pill cut out I love it. So much better than the notch. Compared to the hole cutout in android‚Äôs yes it‚Äôs bigger but I don‚Äôt mind it, especially how Apple has utilized it. Most YouTube videos are bezeled before the island until you use zoom to fill. Even when using zoom to fill it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. Sometimes I like using it just to see the pill cutout (it‚Äôs a weird quirk of mine). And for the 60Hz it‚Äôs not bad. I‚Äôve seen 120 and yeah you notice a difference but IOS is so optimized (for the most part) that it still feels snappy and fast",1,1,iphone15,17bjlhp,11,47,2023-10-19 15:38:12,Top

1. At some point you kinda forget that it‚Äôs there and you get used to it, it‚Äôs not such a big deal, for me anyway
2. There is some getting used to, the transition was easy I just had to reinstall a couple of the apps that I‚Äôm not sure why they did not transfer directly. It‚Äôs gonna sound weird but there are small things that I miss that I did not realise I will - for example being able to see the notification icons in the status bar, I really don‚Äôt like how the notifications work on iOS. I find that the settings are not as intuitive as android but at the same time I was a long time user of android - someone here said that you need to kinda rewrite your brain because they are two different systems and it‚Äôs normal for them to not be the same. 
3. Looove the camera, for me it was worth it, but why I made the switch is not necessarily the camera but the fact that the system ‚Äújust works‚Äù which I‚Äôm very happy with. I somehow always have issues with android and I was sick of it and just wanted something that worked

The dynamic island when watching some wider videos is a little bit annoying compared to a small punch out, but it‚Äôs fine. You barely notice it. 

The battery life is WAY better. I was on a S21, where on heavy use days, I would for sure have to charge my phone in the evening or else it would die. There is no way I would have gone to sleep with a <10% charge because my S21 would die overnight and I‚Äôd miss my alarm. The iPhone has enough battery to last more than a full day, and maybe only discharge 1% overnight unplugged. 

Things run overall smoother. I already had AirPods before the iPhone. The integration is much nicer. 

Face ID > fingerprint 

You lose a ton of customization on iOS. I miss being able to resize widgets. I miss icon swipe functions that I had set up on Nova launcher. I used to use a GPS spoofer on my Galaxy phone to be able to trick certain apps that you can‚Äôt do on iOS. Sideloading is possible on iOS, but is a PITA, whereas on Android it‚Äôs dead simple. 

Notifications are better on Android. 

In the end, both iOS and Android have some things that are done better or worse. Both Samsung/Google and Apple make great phones and software. I‚Äôm very happy with my new iPhone, but if it got stolen tonight and I had to go back to my old Galaxy S21, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd be super upset with having to switch back.",1,1,iphone15,17bjlhp,11,47,2023-10-19 22:57:47,Top

I know it's lacking ProMotion and telephoto camera. But honestly. ProMotion on iPhone has been inconsistent and stuttery anyway. I might miss the telephoto a little bit, but I guess 2x is good enough for portrait photos.

The positive things on the other hand. Much MUCH better battery life! It's slightly cheaper. Seemingly doesn't overheat like the 15 Pro. It only weigh 14 grams more, despite being much larger.

5318,Will 128gb be enough for casual use?,k3upz0w,Holla_99,"256GB is always the safer bet especially if you plan on keeping the phone for several years. I‚Äôve made the mistake several times in the past where I got the smallest available storage cause at the time it sounded like plenty (I also had a extremely limited budget at the time unlike this year). After a good few years that minimum storage is usually not enough anymore and I have to sacrifice a good bit of content I wish I had on my phone.    
    
That being said it really does depend on your use. My Mom and I both came from older 64GB phones both are casual users I just have more content. She had used approx. 20-30GB on her old phone max. While I knew I had surpassed its storage as I had to take my complete music collection off the phone so it wasn‚Äôt full. She got a 128GB 15 Plus and has tons of space and I got the 256GB. Turns out my content takes up just a bit over the 64GB that my old phone was so 256 seems overkill right now but since I want to keep this phone for at least 5 years or more I feel safer about getting 256.    
    
If you are on a tight budget then you can probably get away with 128GB but it will become very frustrating if you ever do run out of storage. If you want to future proof and be on the safe side and can afford it definitely get 256.",1,2,iphone15,171wbc3,26,73,2023-10-07 13:57:46,Top

The only heating incident I had was on the first day I owned it and I had plugged it in to charge. I know it is normal for it to get warm when fast charging, but the amount of heat it had generated was way more than just simply warm. I‚Äôm surprised it didn‚Äôt shut itself off because it was almost as hot as a literal fireball. Despite that, I didn‚Äôt think too much of it because I know when you set up a new device, it has to do some indexing in the background and download stuff from iCloud which I know can cause your device to heat and it drains battery faster. Thankfully, that process is temporary. Aside from that, I haven‚Äôt had any heating issues since then. I charged it last night and while it was expectedly warm from fast charging, it definitely didn‚Äôt get nowhere near as hot as it did the first night when I was charging it.

The Iphone 15 ist 950‚Ç¨ in Germany (EUROS NOT DOLLARS)

I found the phone new and sealed on a site like craigslist but in Germany for 800‚Ç¨.

That price was absolutely amazing and I got the phone and I absolutelyyyy love it. This year I really wanted a more minimalist phone, and I got exactly what I wanted.

The alternative would be to buy the 15 pro, with all the features I don't even need (except 120 hz). And that costs 1250‚Ç¨

THAT IS 450‚Ç¨ MORE, for a phone I DON'T EVEN NEED. It's much bigger of a difference than just saying ""ehh $200 is too much"" so I got the 15. Love it :)",4,0,iphone15,17aijme,18,59,2023-10-18 17:15:01,Top

As much as I love gaming, gaming on your phone will murder your overall battery health in the long run which is the biggest reason why I wouldn‚Äôt be playing AAA games on it.

And, I feel that base model iPhones and pros are closer than ever this year and feels like I didn‚Äôt miss out. I feel a big part of that was the front display by adding the dynamic island and the 2000 nit brightness.

Finally, with the $200 I saved, (nearly 300 from going plus to pro max), I used the money and upgraded my gen 1 AirPods to the AirPod pro 2 usb c which I have 0 regrets.

5497,"Does anybody think the Always-On Display and Telephoto lense are worth an extra $350 between the 15+ and 15PM? (Canadian dollars, already includes tax)",k4nxaq4,TwoCables_from_OCN,"Hell no. $350 is not worth it for these 2 features, unless $350 is like pocket change for you. Y'know?

Can you do a trade-in to significantly reduce the cost? I got a $700 trade-in with my carrier (Xfinity) for my iPhone 11 and Always On Display is one of the reasons why I chose iPhone 15 Pro over the 15. The other is ProMotion because it makes all movement butter-smooth and I just ***love*** it. If I were paying full price though, then I'd still have iPhone 11. Or if my trade-in were like say *half* as much, then I would've had to settle for the 15 and I wouldn't have felt comfortable playing with the Pro model at the Apple Store because then I'd have found out what I couldn't have. Once I tried the Pro model, I immediately decided there was no way I would go back to considering the 15.

Anyway, I ***love*** Always On Display. I've been using Tap to Wake since September 2019, and so I'm extremely happy to finally put that to an end. Now my Lock Screen is always ***glanceable***! To decide if it's worth $350 more to you just to have this and a Telephoto camera, pay attention to how often you wake your phone just to see the Lock Screen and consider whether not having to do that would be worth $350 extra, and also pay attention to how often you'd strongly prefer to zoom in with an actual Telephoto camera to get true optical zooming up to 5x. These 2 things would most definitely not be worth it for me. $350 is a ton of money to me. I think these 2 things would be worth about $50 more though. For sure. Or maybe $100 more.

Also consider how important photo and video quality is to you though. I've seen people say that they think there's an obvious difference between a photo and video taken with a 15 vs. a 15 Pro. Just at 1x! For some reason I didn't test the cameras at the store.

These aren't the only differences to consider of course. The Pro models have the Action Button, which I love: [https://www.phonetui.com/2023/10/iphone-action-button-on-iphone-15-pro.html](https://www.phonetui.com/2023/10/iphone-action-button-on-iphone-15-pro.html) I just use it for the Flashlight though because with how I use my iPhone, this is what I decided I want the Action Button to do, but knowing what else it can do thanks to this article and video adds a ton of value to this phone for me. Even so, just being able to reliably turn the flashlight on and off is a big upgrade for me. Have you ever had a failed on or off for the flashlight from the Lock Screen? It was a frustratingly daily occurrence for me. It wasn't reliable.

Another thing to consider is whether you'd want the ability to do professional-level editing of your photos and videos thanks to ProRAW and Apple ProRes. To some people, this is worth the higher cost of the Pro series all by itself. Not for me though. However, this combined with the superior camera system is the main contributing factor to the higher cost. I think in addition to that the build quality is up there in the ""major contributing factor"" category. I don't think Always On Display and a Telephoto camera really adds to the cost so much that it's $350 more just for those 2 things! Or maybe the Telephoto camera does add a significant amount to the cost but I think the $350 difference is largely due to ProRAW, ProRes, and just the generally how much better the photo and video quality is and the build quality of the phone.

So yeah, I think it would be unwise to pay $350 more just to have Always On Display and a Telephoto camera unless you'd value those so highly that you'd never regret paying that much more just to have those 2 features while possibly not caring about all the others.",6,1,iphone15,176ouob,6,21,2023-10-13 04:24:14,Top

For me, AOD, the telephoto lens, extra RAM, 120Hz display, 256gb starting storage, better camera hardware and software, newer processor, faster USB-C speeds, the action button, and new build quality were worth the extra. 

Those two features alone make it tougher to justify the $350 CAD expense. However, you have to see if the other differences add up and make sense, especially with your budget/wallet in mind. 

If the other features make sense for you, then I'd go for the Pro Max. If not, then the Plus is the way to go. 

Can't go wrong with the Plus because it has tons of good features, like the best battery life on any 15 series iPhone, a 2x optical zoom without the need of a telephoto lens, good camera upgrades from prior models, dynamic island, super bright display to see outside, etc.",2,0,iphone15,176ouob,6,21,2023-10-13 17:03:46,Top

5511,15 plus difference to 14 pro max?,k24tbxv,TPM_521,"All I‚Äôve heard about the 15 pro max overheating is purely anecdotal from a single YouTube reviewer who said it was overheating when editing video onboard, which is a super specific use case and IMO something most people probably won‚Äôt do if they‚Äôre really shooting ProRes and using the footage for professional purposes since editing is SO much easier and faster on a desktop/laptop computer.

I think it‚Äôs almost always worth getting the latest gem when you upgrade. I just upgraded from an X to a 15 Pro Max. Any savings you may get buying a 14 right now will be offset in the relative loss you‚Äôll see when trading in your phone.

Plus, USB-C will future proof you for several years. You kept an iPhone 8 for this long, you‚Äôll be keeping your next phone for a while too, I‚Äôd imagine- and by then I can basically guarantee you that most of you peripherals and day to day accessories will be on USB-C. It will be convenient to have that usability with your phone as well.

I have had no issues with my phone personally- I‚Äôve only had it since yesterday evening so I can‚Äôt really say I‚Äôve put it through the ringer but it‚Äôs more than capable of handling day to day activities.

Whether to choose the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max depends on your personal preferences and needs.

The main differences between the two models are the size of the display and the battery life. The iPhone 15 Pro Max has a larger display and a longer battery life than the iPhone 15 Pro. If you prefer a larger display and a longer battery life, then the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the better choice.

However, if you are looking for a more compact phone or if you are on a budget, then the iPhone 15 Pro is still a great option. It has the same powerful A17 Bionic chip and the same camera system as the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

Ultimately, the best way to decide which phone is right for you is to try them both out and see which one you prefer.

I thought I would miss the 120 Hz display, the Pro‚Äôs camera system‚Ä¶ but I actually find myself surprised I was even so bothered with it. 

For the added battery life, barely any heat, I don‚Äôt see myself envy those with a Pro model again. 

Sometimes less is more, and having all those zoom options did confuse me a bit at times. I am pleased with x1 & x2 zoom which comes with the base models. I spend less time worrying about what angle and zoom is the best for the scene, and take more images, which I can crop in with the 24MP final image. 

I haven‚Äôt really suffered a downgrade to 60 Hz display either, which I was most concerned about. In fact, the only place it is noticeable is app transitions (open/close) and swiping between app pages. It‚Äôs very easy to get used to, to my surprise. 

I gotta say, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be looking for a Pro model again unless there is a significant attention to the weight (weight balance) of the devices, as I find the cameras to weigh it down a lot, particularly when crammed into a smaller Pro shape. The larger Pro Max have always some how felt lighter in the hand, due to its wider weight distribution.

* A better flash for the camera, with 9 LEDs in a square, and iOS ""intelligently"" chooses the pattern based on the subject and its distance from the camera to get the best results possible with this flash
* The ProMotion display. It's an awesome luxury, making everything have a silky-smooth motion. It's a difference you wouldn't notice on other iPhones until you experience ProMotion. I remember reading about ProMotion and almost laughing saying everything moves smoothly enough for me on my iPhone 11. That may still be true but seriously, ProMotion is far better.
* An Always-On Display
* The Action Button
* A more ergonomic location of the Side Button. This might not sound like much, but if you're like me and you are usually pressing the lower part of the Side Button and if you find you accidentally take screenshots very easily, then you will ***love*** having the Side Button positioned lower.

5672,15 vs 15 Plus dilemma,k2ji9ac,remyj1991,"The plus got the best battery in any iPhone, how many SOT doe you have on your Asus? 15 gives you 6-8 plus gives you 8-11.

I had the 14 plus and now the 15 and the size from the 15 is now perfect for me, the 14/15 Plus is really a brick. But if you really care about battery its the best choice",8,1,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 05:55:27,Top
5673,15 vs 15 Plus dilemma,k2k9fop,Holla_99,"After extensive research I went with the plus and I have no regrets. I came from an older smaller iPhone which is comparable in size the the regular 15.    
    
1. No idea how long the regular 15 lasts I know it is longer than my old phone but probably not a huge difference. Depending on use my old phone would barely make it to the end of a day on a good day or not at all on a heavier use day.    
    
2. I‚Äôve never had 120hz so I can‚Äôt really compare there but the bigger screen doesn‚Äôt make 60hz look any worse than it did on my old phone. If anything it looks even better.    
    
3. Bigger screen and much longer lasting battery is worth the $150 to me personally.    
    
4. The Plus is marginally wider and heavier than my old smaller phone so I don‚Äôt find it all that big. It is surprisingly light to hold. It‚Äôs just a fair bit taller. I also have rather small hands and adjusted to the size of the Plus easily within a day or two.    
    
5. I used my old phone without being careful of the battery health and it took over 4 years to drop below 80% at which point I was finally able to get it replaced by Apple (without Apple Care). Everyone‚Äôs use is different though. With my 15 Plus I plan on using the new 80% charge limit feature as I‚Äôm finding even just 80% of a charge can easily get me through the day and only use the included cable to charge. I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôd be able to do the same with a regular size 15.    
    
Anyways the final choice is yours of course but I figured I‚Äôd share my experience with the 15 Plus. Hopefully this helps.",6,1,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 11:29:18,Top
5674,15 vs 15 Plus dilemma,k2jipxk,Suhorang,"I'm in the same boat, I got the 15 regular but I think I'm switching to the plus variant. The regular is the ideal size u just have to get used to it. It's lightweight and good to go but I also switched from Android but I like the bigger screen so I think I'll get the Plus. Once you use as large size there's no going back",6,2,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 06:00:40,Top
5675,15 vs 15 Plus dilemma,k2jolw2,paranoidevil,"1. Optimalized charging when is ‚Äúlearned‚Äù it will complete charging at 100% and it pause charging when u charge overnight with same adapter (it takes 2 weeks to learn, when u use once 5w and then 20w it will not work very well - anyway in day it will stop at 80% when u wanna male extra charging). 

2. U can live without it, if u used 120 and 60 and both was okay u will not notice anything. I used 14 pro with 120hz and now im on 15 with 60hz and nothing special noticed. Screen size doesnt matter.

3. I think here its on u, u like more thickness but smaller or thin but bigger device? Btw apple magsafe battery pack is around 100$ (its gently to ur battery, it drain from pack and then when empty from phone, not charging as other powerbanks) so here is difference the 50$.

4. If u think about 50$ extra spent is much, even with apple care u will need pay for repairs but not full price - as i read here (not my personal experience). Also cant say durability, i have mine 6 days but im with case. I think for u will be better just go with case and glass (even thin trasparent will help) but its my option. 

5. I heard about if it drops below 80% before device is year old, its on warranty (faulty). Im charging wireless with 10w overnight with optimalized charging on and my 13 mini was after year 99% health (11 pro after 18 months 96%, same charger). So if u will charge wireless overnight with like 5-10w its okay (better than 20w in day - my mothers iphone 13 which was charger like that was 95% after 10months and she use phone less than me). Also cant say if they replace with apple care (i cant have, my country doesnt support it - only resellers and it like 200$/year). 

So solution can be for u just buy 15 where u can return (i think directly from apple then), and if u will be unhappy just return and bring 15 plus? I see u care about phone size, so it can be solution. Hope this helped.
My 15 got 8,5hours screen on with 25% left (saving mode on, background app refresh off).",4,2,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 07:11:58,Top
5676,15 vs 15 Plus dilemma,k2lrf0m,yaths17,I currently have the 5.8 inch screen 11 pro. I like small phones but when it comes to watching Netflix or YouTube I do not enjoy it as much on this size as I used to on my pixel 2 xl with 6 inch screen. So next I‚Äôm planning to get a 15 plus for that giant screen with largest battery (or most hours of screen on time) on an iphone till date. Also now there‚Äôs an option in battery settings which stops charging past 80% whatsoever. So I‚Äôd put it on a slow 5w wireless charging pad while going to sleep with the 80% threshold and optimised charging switched on and be worry free.,2,1,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 17:27:08,Top
5677,15 vs 15 Plus dilemma,k2kjbjo,Lbenn0707,"I‚Äôve got the 15. I decided to test the battery life and although for years I‚Äôve put my phone on the charger over night, the last two nights I didn‚Äôt. I went to bed with it at 86% night before last, I charged twice yesterday for 20ish mins (my work commute lol ) and that was it. Regular usage. I actually listened to xm radio all afternoon yesterday at work and during lunch, I watched a show on Amazon prime. When I went to bed last night I was still at 54%. 

What I DID notice is Reddit and possibly Facebook being open, even if I‚Äôm not actively on them, seem to cause the battery to drain quicker. I tried to force myself to remember to shut them completely down when I wasn‚Äôt actively on them. 
I will say I was busy at work and I‚Äôm in school at night so I may not have been quite as active on the phone as I could be so that may have been a fluke. 

I‚Äôm at 58% right now. After using the phone this morning (social media and email check ins lol ) and having it on the car charger on my way in to work this morning. 

I can‚Äôt speak to the size between the two. The plus phones are just too big for me. I prefer the smaller ones. Good luck on your decision!",1,0,iphone15,16u58sz,10,24,2023-09-28 12:51:32,Top

If you don‚Äôt care about the refresh rate, get the base 15.

The second is the camera. The 15 Pro camera is far superior to the 15 camera. If you take mostly snapshots, then the 15 has a great camera.  If you‚Äôre into serious photography on your iPhone, then you want the Pro.

Software wise, the enterprise versions are geared more toward business than personal use. Well, not necessarily geared toward business, just more business capable from the outset. 

They're also more secure. HOWEVER, being a mistake, if it's not actually registered as an enterprise version in the sale, you might not get the additional benefits that enterprise editions normally get, such as the Knox suite for free for a year and the firmware and security updates for at least four years.

For me, personally, I'd contact the place you got it from and ask if having the Enterprise version vs what the actual sale says is going to cause any issues. I don't think it will, but it'd be better to ask, just in case. The worst they can say is, ""Oops, we made a mistake.

6395,So happy!!,kcxqvj7,Prestigious_Factor38,"Are you in New York? NYC area? I've been looking for someone to pair up with to buy the s23 ultra.

At T-Mobile you can get $800 with a qualifying plan. If you add the 55 + your old discount to the qualifying plan the price is reduced to like $75 and then for every additional plan the price is reduced by five more dollars, with the lowest being like 65 I think for the Go5G plus plan.

There's also a price reduction for the plant if you are military or a first responder.

So $800 off and you get the premium plans for like 65 bucks If you can get three people. 

$800 off each other phone FYI. Which means you can get an $800 phone for free or an $1,100 phone for $300.

The way the company makes money on these deals is by forcing you into the high priced plans for like 24 or 36 months. I think the specific one is 24 months.

Edit: Don't quote me on all the numbers, but it's something like that. I was checking it out like 2 or 3 weeks ago. But it's all still active. If you get the most premium Go5G plan, I believe you can get $1,000 off the phone. I think the $1,000 option is still active too, but I'm not positive. I know the $800 one is because I checked the other day.

Also My mom is 55 so I was going to use her credit to get the 55 plus discount. But she doesn't want to join because she uses a $30 a month plan.

Also from the way I understood what I read, this can be done for up to four phones. 

Basically pair up with some people to get the price of the premium plan down to an ideal monthly price and then everyone chooses the phone they want and proceed from there with payments, etc. But I don't know anyone unfortunately. Sadface.jpeg",1,0,GalaxyS23,18fqh11,95,29,2023-12-11 19:50:11,Top

\+Very good sounding speakers

\+Very good overall camera experience

\+very good overall performance(8gen2 is awesome)

\+price has dropped a lot, so its more affordable now.

\+S pen is nice to have,even if you never use it(something unique compared to other phones).

\+Good battery life overall.

\+Good software support so far

\+Samsung Dex is nice to have

\+One of the fiew devices that uses Ultrasonic sensor

\+doesnt overheat

\-Base version should be 12gb ram and not 8(European version)

\-No charger in the box

\-very high starting price and bad resale value for those that bought day one

\-curved screen and tempered glass compatibility

\-fast charging is behind competition

\-not comfortable to hold one handed or carry for many, due to its big size

I traded mine for base S23, and while i miss its better battery life and camera(or bigger screen for media consumption),i dont miss the curved screen(hated that i couldnt use a tempered glass) or the increased weight. 

I also dont baby sit my phone like with S23Ultra, since base S23 is more comfortable to hold/carry.

If S24Ultra has a flat screen like rumors say, i may be tempted to switch for the better battery and cameras, if 8 gen3 is as good as 8 gen2.",6,0,GalaxyS23,18fs5jf,22,65,2023-12-11 14:31:48,Top

It gets me through the day every single day, sometimes I might have to charge for like 20 minutes if it's a crazy long day. About the cameras. I was never into photography and didn't even really care about cameras but man this phone got me hooked. Every nice place I go now I take photos and videos of it . In every chance, I take it out to take a selfie with me gf. Photos of my nephew and niece are a bit more difficult on this phone and indoors they are pretty much impossible but it makes up for it with CRAZY DSLR like portraits and crazy good video for an Android. Nothing bad to say about the SD 8 gen 2 this Soc is just awesome, it never fails anything ,even when you try to make it lag it doesn't. The screen is outstanding but its a bit dull if you compare it to previous gens . Screen protectors, I have put one in march( Whitestone Dom)and it's still on , fingerprint works fine , never had problems with it . The one thing that still bothers me is that I had to change my lifestyle to carry this phone . In summer I'm always on a motorbike and this thing is way too big for any pocket, so I'm forced to always have a little bag with me .

I had the option to get any of the 3 in the lineup (base, plus, and ultra), and I chose the plus mainly due to its size. The plus offers basically everything I need - the ultras corners are rather sharp for me as I use my phone for long periods and the base model has a small display as to what I need (also coming from a similar size phone as the plus version so going to the base version would be uncomfortable for the first few weeks). The camera is GREAT on both. The 100√ó on ultra is great, but if you're into photography and videography, just get professional cameras as they'll do you better on content. That's on the feels. 

Now down to values, on the plus compared to base, you're getting slightly better thermals due to size (both stops at around ~ 40¬∞C though, but again, 23+ offers better) and you're getting about 2 ~ 3 hours of better battery life. The display on the plus is also noticeably better, and you'd enjoy it more compared to the base version if you're watching something or even gaming. 

Apart from these, there isn't any difference. Both are still beasts, and you won't regret your choices with either of them.

It makes some sense that the download of an update used up 'some' space, but yours is a big drop.  I wonder if it uses a lot of temporary space, and releases it after the next restart, or similar.

EDIT TO ADD: did you drill down on 'storage' and see a message 'get xxx of space by deleting old installation files from the downloads folder'

See the screen shot in this post:

>What is this android package for? ""vendor.qti.data.txpwradmin""

It says something like:

The package vendor.qti.data.txpwradmin is part of Qualcomm's proprietary Android middleware, and it is responsible for managing the transmit power of LTE and Wi-Fi radios on Qualcomm-based devices. 

This includes functions such as:

* Optimizing transmit power levels to improve battery life and network performance


* Adapting transmit power based on environmental factors and network conditions


* Enforcing regulatory compliance requirements for transmit power


The StxPwrService component within this package provides a service interface for other applications to query and control transmit power settings. This allows Qualcomm's proprietary software stacks, such as the modem firmware and Qualcomm's own cellular network stack, to manage transmit power in a way that is optimized for both performance and efficiency.

If you encounter errors or issues related to the vendor.qti.data.txpwradmin package, it is recommended to contact Qualcomm support or consult the documentation for your specific device.",3,1,GalaxyS23,18cv53y,1,7,2023-12-07 18:38:44,Top

Ringke Onyx is fantastic for that. Form what I've tried and seen around, it's the best compromise between slim form factor and protection.

It has a grippy texture, raised slightly around the edges of each camera, and a raise on top/bottom screen, with the middle part of the screen edge lowered so to be more usable with gestures. Its corners are also slightly beefier to protect the glass from the most dangerous drops. It's a great design!

No

>The gestures to switch to the previous app is not reliable compared to iOS gestures (swiping sligltly up and to the side), do I have to change something or am I performing the gesture wrong?

Had the same experience. I never liked the gestures anyways, switched to the OG Android buttons which allows me to a. switch apps by double tapping the task view button and b. switch to one handed view by double tapping the home button. You lose a bit of screen estate but it doesn't bother me. YMMV.

>Tapping on the clock to go to the top of the screen, is there a samsung version of this?

As far as I know there is no native way BUT there are hundreds of apps on the play store that can do this. I can't seem to recall some names though because I don't use it.

>I can't mute the mic during an outgoing call before the person picks up? 

I'm afraid this is not possible on OneUI. Not entirely sure about this but as far as I know it's not possible.

Samsung said it was going to give me around $450 USD (give or take cause conversion) on their website. I sent my phone to a 3rd party company that does the valuations and the payment here in Mexico and a few weeks later (it's a bit slow) they actually gave me the full $450 USD which is a lot more.

The SIM to eSIM is just a transfer on the Verizon side if they support the eSIM. So you just need to visit a Verizon store or maybe you can do it over their website if they have a client tool for that. 

>  
do typical International services all support the use of eSIMs these days, and should I therefore simply keep the eSIM available for future use?

That depends where you are going. Some countries might have just SIM and some will have SIM and eSIM.

Here in Mexico the eSIM is getting pretty popular but in the cheap *MVNO* cause you get the eSIM with some data for really cheap and then you port the number to another company for benefits and then repeat once the benefits end in company 1.

However, the biggest company in the country (Telcel) will only hand you an eSIM if you get a monthly plan. AT&T sometimes allows you to get one but that depends of the store and the guys that work in that particular store.

  
One thing to notice. I don't remember having the eSIM option like that when I had a locked phone so chances are big that your phone is unlocked if I'm not mistaken.",3,0,GalaxyS23,18b3wz8,2,7,2023-12-05 05:06:57,Top

On top of that I also used my S10 for a tradein discount .. So it was dirt cheap compared to what it normally costs.

My old phone was in perfect condition and had 0 scratches even after 5 years of use. But the battery life was slowly getting worse + I wouldn't get the security updates in the future with the 5 years support limit.

Since I live in the EU, my S10 came with the Exynos chip. But this has never really been an issue for me. The phone has served me well for nearly 5 years and It's been used a lot!

I will say tho, that there is night and day between the battery life of the S10 and the S23 .. Even from new the S10 wouldn't be able to hold up. But you have to take a few things into consideration as well.

Screen resolution is not the same (which is very easy to spot on the S23). So obviously the S10 would require a bit more power to run a higher resolution.

I'm over all happy with the S23 and I really hope the battery will keep performing like this for another 4-5 years.

I thought the difference was over exagerated, but it really isn't.

All the people suggesting you clean cache (does this ever even do anything? Most useless advice...), or turn on/off features, misunderstood your problem - it's not with phone performance, it's with how the task switcher works.

My only advice is to use the double-tap on the task switcher gesture to quickly switch between two most recent apps. That's always super fast, and no need to wait on any animation to finish.

It won't be as good as hardware based but you can improve it by recording the fingerprints in the way you use finger to unlock your device.

Needless to say, my S23+ has been a reliable device on the hardware end with a solid UX with OneUI. It's not my favorite take on Android, but it has customizability and good software support to back up the rest of the phone. And all of those things that went wrong with my Pixel 7 are not issues on this device.

I want to bring a bit of nuance to this, though.

The manufacturer has leeway on where they want to define ""0%"" and ""100%"".

From what I gather ‚Äî and take what I'm saying with a grain of salt ‚Äî it's more of a question of voltage. They could decide to make the battery stop charging once its internal state reaches 4.1 volts, which reduces the chemistry degradation a lot, but they'd be leaving some capacity on the table. So they could decide to go higher, up to to 4.15, maybe even 4.2 (which is where things can start getting dangerous).

I don't have any data to prove it, but I have a very strong suspicion that cheaper devices (and even some mid to high end laptops) do this to squeeze out more advertised battery life. They eagerly cut into the long-term lifespan to provide a slightly longer charge in the first couple hundred uses.

But yeah.

* Avoid heat when charging, always
* Slower charge is most likely beneficial (it does avoid heat, too)
* 20 to 80% is a great rule of thumb",6,2,GalaxyS23,186xyyf,17,46,2023-11-29 20:14:47,Top
7740,Charging from ~25 to 85%,kbb0e30,NefariousnessJaded87,"The only **real facts** you can find on LiPo batteries (Google the manufacturers) are these:

**Do not deplete below 20%**

**Do not heat up when using or charging**

Everything else is someone's opinion. May be right or not.

So in your scenario, charging from 10% would be worse than multiple charging from 25%-85%. Charging daily from \~25 to 85% does not hurt the battery, but you limit your capacity. Charging to 100% and disconnecting the charger once the battery is full, is better than charging overnight and leaving it on the charger. Trickle charging is worse than not charging.

So, there are no real guidelines except the two I presented to you. Rest I up to you.Tip: You can make routines to control your battery state, ie. charge to 85%, stop, then once a week maybe charge to 100%.

My advice, use it as you see fit, just avoid depleting it below 20% if you want to keep it healthy for a long time.

You'd be better off not to worry about it because after 3 years or so of normal charging your battery will only be degraded about 20% max.

- Keeping the battery around 100% for a long time is actually more harmful.

Voc√™ tem que considerar o sistema e se ele te agrada... De uma forma geral o iPhone tem um bom sistema, mas com limitadas formas de personaliza√ß√£o pois a Apple se considera capaz de dizer exatamente oq voc√™ quer e pronto. E para a maioria das pessoas ela pode at√© estar certa... No meu caso, n√£o. 

Com rela√ß√£o a hardware, as c√¢meras do s23 est√£o superiores do que a do 14(15 √© superior) em v√°rios aspectos, com a ressalva que em 60fps 4k que voc√™ n√£o pode mudar entre as lentes que est√£o gravando depois de iniciar a grava√ß√£o. Mas no iPhone, voc√™ tbm n√£o pode pausar, mudar para a selfie, voltar e etc, no Android voc√™ pode. No Samsung voc√™ tamb√©m pode alterar todas as configura√ß√µes da c√¢mera, ISO, Exposure, White balance e etc. iPhone te d√° 0.5x, 1x e 3x, se n√£o me engano, e se quiser mudar algo √© depois que a foto j√° foi tirada, na edi√ß√£o, novamente mostrando que a Apple acha que sabe oq voc√™ quer melhor do que voc√™.

I did notice the 120Hz on the iPhone to look and feel smoother than on the S23U and the relatively consistent oversaturation of colors in the pictures I took on the galaxy started to bother me real quick, I had bread look yellow and grass look like it was drawn in with lime color marker more than once

Personalization wise, just about any android phone under the sun will absolutely dust an iPhone but Apple has consistently been getting better with letting you add a little personal flair *the Apple way* on their phones so if you don‚Äôt wanna go TOO crazy either should work for you. I‚Äôm fairly confident Samsung does make it *less* fluid and ever so slightly more clunky to use if you install a 3rd party launcher tho, so just be weary of that if you plan on going deep into the customization rabbit hole on the galaxy side 

Design wise either of the phones are gonna be perfectly fine, some people don‚Äôt like the sharp corners on the ultra but that didn‚Äôt bother me and it‚Äôs a nonissue on the other 2 S23s, the iPhone 15 Pro lineup however, has some incredibly thin bezels if that‚Äôs your thing

Consistent updates wise, Samsung says they‚Äôre doing 4 years for flagships and afaik Apple is still supporting all the way back to the iPhone XR with iOS 17 so either way you go it should last you a while if you want it to

I‚Äôm on a 15 Pro currently and it really boiled down to the fact I live in the US and iMessage/FaceTime are the default rather than just about everywhere else where WhatsApp and friends are the go to, the fact I liked the way the pictures look straight out of camera more, and being a raver and wanting to take the absolute best videos I can while at events, and being able to send my videos to friends with relative ease, I‚Äôm also just particularly fond of iOS, I thought I missed Android and I ended up just missing iOS after switching

As far as the oversaturation, you can turn off hdr and the other post-processing stuff in camera assistant as well. Or you can just shoot in RAW.

8066,Upgrade from Pixel 6 to S23 or Pixel 8,kb0qwcb,jake0456,"For me personally, I switched from the Pixel line.  I had a 5a(motherboard failure) and 7(overheating, weaker signal, worse battery life).  Cameras aren't important to me though, so I can't comment much on that.  Obviously, the Pixel 8 will be better as I do know Samsung usually oversaturates a bit, but you can install a gcam port at least for that.

What I do love about the S23+(in my case) is that I can rip out as much of OneUI as I want and Pixelfy it a bit.  Goodlock is also awesome and allows for further customization.  My S23+ has never overheated like the current Pixel's do.  Battery life, signal, performance are just better overall.  Samsung may be known for bloat, and more bloat with their software but their hardware is excellent

Also, I'm suspicious of the ""bumps"" that are being reported on the Pixel 8 display.  It's clearly components of the phone being pushed against the OLED and while Google says it's no big deal....it very well might be and they should probably extend the warranty for it.",2,1,GalaxyS23,1859qge,6,8,2023-11-27 20:26:14,Top

It takes some time to produce good pictures, but I dont mind spending 1-2 minutes extra to have a really good photo to post online.  S23 has raw on all lenses, main one 50 mp.

For video, s23 again ahead because of that 8k 30 video in PRO MODE. I have a 4k display and can easily spot the difference between pixel and samsung videos. The 4k from pixel(also from samsung) are overshaprened, but the 8k from SAmsung is barely sharpened. And because it is recorded in pro mode, the colors are more natural.

The S23 Ultra is noticeably heavier than the Note 10+, and is a bit larger too.  I guess your choice depends on your needs and field of work.  Personally, I've been an S pen addict since my first Note (3), so naturally, I went with the Ultra.  For anybody wearing skinny jeans, you can forget about putting that one in your pockets!!

If it wasn't enough already, I put it in an OtterBox Defender case, along with a Whitestone Dome glass protector.  The whole package currently weights in at 312 grams (about 3/4 pound)üòÖüòÇ

I barely use my phone as a phone; I read, watch videos and use Messenger.  Meaning I need the biggest screen possible as I do not want to buy a tablet.  It is the perfect device for this.  I wear cargo pants daily so I could care less about the size or heft.

All that being said, I do hate curved screens.  Makes me buy 59 CAN$ screen protectors.  And I plainly never understood why they actually make them curved.  If I simply wanted a hi-end phone, and didn't care about the pen, nor did I care about having the biggest possible screen, maybe I'd get the Plus.

amFilm and Spigen are both 0.33mm glass and work with the fingerprint reader. I didn't even have to re-register any fingers and the tap-to-wake&unlock still works. The important part is making sure the fingerprint reader section is clean of all debris and dust by shining a bright flashlight at the screen during install.

I personally preferred the amFilm kit because it's half the price of the Spigen kit and came with a big dust removal sticker, but it has a selfie cam cutout while the Spigen kit covers the whole screen. The U-shaped cutout can be distracting but on the other hand it prevents finger smudges from interfering with the camera.

Incredibly responsive unit.. good choice for those who don't have any time to waste.. Unless the app is particularly poorly coded or whatnot, everything runs lightning fast and smooth.

Mad props to Qualcomm for developing such a powerful and efficient chipset in SM8550.

(One should not consider S23 FE which is equipped with an inferior chipset)

S23 is able to ""hear me"" from long distances. So when I can't find the phone in a place I'll simply say ""Hey Google"" and it'll respond from a far corner that I can hardly hear. I'd also  not get up to fetch it for certain tasks but instead would just ""hey google"" it from where I stand, and it responds incredibly quickly. This kind of use of a phone is still surprising if not shocking to people around me.

My daily screen time average is around 80 mins. I recharge it every three days. (120 Hz enabled)

8269,Galaxy s23 vs Iphone 13 pro max?,katnwhb,Plokimon,"Reasons for S23, you might not need all of these but just listing whatever is coming off the top of my head-

Usb Type C- faster charging, better support, less chargers/cables to carry, better accessory support (which would be usable in other devices as well and not just one phone) , cheaper cables, ability to use HDMI, faster data transfer

Can reverse powershare - I have charged many iPhones for friends who need to charge their phones and are unable to find a lightning cable. If I forget the charger for my earphones or watch, i can charge using my phone. It also works while the phone is charging.


Being able to cast wirelessly to most screens (miracast/chromecast) and not just airplay compatible, useful also in hotel rooms. Also able to play something on the wireless screen while playing using the phone for something else

Heavily customizable - can use simply like an iPhone and everything would work, but you have an option to tweak all the little things to make things better for your liking, especially using GoodLock by samsung ( e.g I have customized the navigation gestures to do 90% of the things on my phone without having to readjust my grip and reaching far with my thumb)

You can also set different buttons to do different things as per your wish 

Much more capable file manager

Can stream to multiple bluetooth devices at once - have used this to watch movies on the go with friends without having to share earphones/headphones ( works across brands, even airpods), can adjust volumes and everything for each device, can even play different things on each device

Even outside of bluetooth can play multiple audio at once ( e.g when you are scrolling instagram with music playing, it wont stop the music again and again whenever something with audio comes up )

Splitscreen/ Multi window - Ability to use multiple apps at once, or pinning things on top easily. (E.g i have used this a lot of times to bring up calculator while looking at some data on the screen or to copy things from one app to another manually when copy paste is not possible and many more things

Good compatibility with IOT smart devices, none of the IOT devices I have support Apple Home, but they support Google Home or SmartThings which can be easily controlled just by pulling down the notification shade.

Easier to transfer files between devices, between other androids and windows ( extremely easy and fast using nearby share ), for any other random device, if its a small files you can atleast share using bluetooth without having to upload it somewhere and share

That reminds me of link-sharing. You can just share large files using links also .. it will be uploaded to cloud and the other person can download and the link can deactivate on its own based on the time set. 

Better screen recording - from what I know when you record screen on iphones it shows the control panel at the end which is just weird

Better audio codes supported for bluetooth devices

Google assistant and bixby are better than Siri afaik

Can also an entire desktop mode wired or wirelessly. (Dex) 

Depending on your country -
1. Samsung Pay/Google Pay might have better support 
2. Repairs might be cheaper",3,2,GalaxyS23,1844rvk,6,28,2023-11-26 11:36:01,Top

I concluded that the S23 Ultra, even with the largest battery, isn't really significant considering the more premium and demanding screen size & resolution.

The base S23 has the smallest battery capacity, while obviously the S23+ has the bigger battery. Even with the bigger screen, it's not pushing high screen resolution or high ppi. Actually, the Plus has the least amount of ppi: 425 for base, 393 for the Plus, and 500 for the ultra. So to me, it looks like all the factors put into the Plus makes it a battery stand out without too many compromises. 

Have been using this Plus since October and super happy with it. I've yet to kill it in a single day.

Storage is also a thing if you can't get the 256gb s23 base, it's not a problem for me but I also don't take a billion pictures or run large games. 

I have the base because I'm in love with the size. It's just so comfortable and easy to handle. I had forgotten how much I love using phones this size after years of prioritizing the largest screen size I could get. I only charge to 85 and get a day and a half easy, and then a quick hour charge back to 85.

8661,Why do people pay 1100 ‚Ç¨ for a Iphone 14 Pro,k0q6ghj,Shaky_elm,"I left an iPhone (12 mini) to move to Android. First tried the pixel 7 pro which was a very negative experience (no native music player for music files on phone, photo quality was way below advertised, couldn't connect to Bluetooth devices/car) and ended up switching after a few days to the, at the time very new, S23. Much better experience over the pixel 7. However, it's no iPhone pro competitor. My partner has a 13 pro, so we've done some comparisons. 

First off the big one for us: photo quality. iPhone pro is basically professional quality, S23 is good but doesn't compare. As part of partners job involves photography and videography, the iPhone gets the win for raw quality and adjustability (native photo editing).

Screen: as an everyday user, they are both very good, high quality and durable. Unless you look at a spec sheet, any regular person won't notice a difference. We've both dropped them on some hard surfaces before we got them into some sturdy cases with screen protectors.

User interface: this one is personal preference, but honestly, the iPhone is much easier to navigate, find things in settings and adjust quality of life things (such as gestures, S23 is very, very limited there)

Battery: I think my S23 technically has a better battery, I barely use mine and drain about 40-60% per day. While my partner is a very, very heavy user (as it doubles as a work phone) and gets through about 70-80% of total battery life per day. So realistically, I'd be tempted to give iPhone the win on this one, but either way you'll get a full day from them.

Overall: the S23 is a great phone, has some really good features. But it doesn't stand up to the iPhone pro's. 

Sincerely a S23 owner.

For starters, you mentioned it's a second hand phone, do you know if it once had the screen/back/etc replaced? Because for sure this will remove any water resistance. And as others said, micro cracks on the screen can be enough to get water in. Additionally, just the steam of the shower can be enough to damage your phone, so even if you don't let water touch it, things can still go wrong in the long run. Lastly, Samsung doesn't cover any water damage and that's the first signal you should take to use the water resistance as an emergency thing (eg dropped it in the sink or something) and not as ""oh, I'll take a shower because it's IP68"".

8795,Should I ask for a replacement?,joq5aod,None,"In my opinion, this isn't banana gate since I believe you only experience this in close up shots (like taking a picture of a piece of paper). This isn't the camera's fault. The main lens is simply not designed to click close up shots like the one you tried to click. 

But if you try to click the same picture using the 3x lens, you'll see that the picture comes out perfect. That's because the 3x lens is designed to take close up shots. 
So, the problem isn't the main camera, the problem is most people using the wrong lens to click close up shots and then confusing it as banana gate.

If your phone had banana gate issue, you'd see that the blur appears in ALL the pictures you click using the main camera (not just close up shots).

Not surprising considering you were basically taking macro shots of labels from a 4-5 inches away on a phone that doesn't have a macro lens. There are several opinions on how to properly test for this issue and most aren't so close up as it sounds like you were doing. Also, that close to a subject and it's easy for the focus plane to be off. 

Someone did a poll here a couple of weeks ago and last I saw, out of 170 responses, it was 21% with the issue 79% without the issue. I've tested my S23+ in various ways and have only seen the bokeh effect when I was taking a picture of a small square instruction booklet from 4-5 inches away, but moving out to 12 inches with a legal sheet full of text my unit had no blur areas. Most test with text, but I also tested with a fine weaved blanket I have, but no banana, or other, blur testing from 12 to 36 inches away. I tested with several text scanning apps and the text extracting function of the camera with no issues fortunately. Still, I guess 21% is a big enough number. 

One reason the Ultra might look fine is the the S23U has a AF function in the UW lens, and it automatically changes from the Wide to the UW lens in near distance, that‚Äôs why it looks different between the S23 Ultra and S23/S23+.",-1,2,GalaxyS23,13079at,2,27,2023-04-27 05:13:58,Top

If it is purely a ""large sensor thing"", not a lens defect, then tell me, how fullframe and medium format cameras with infinitely bigger sensor than the S23 can take a completely fine picture of a flat sheet of paper, zero blur, but the s23 produces a circular blur on the photo?

It is because the **plane of focus** on the S23 is not really a flat plane like on professional lenses, but instead it is kinda spherical, you can find that defect on some real lenses too.

Samsung could have added a variable aperture, or made the phone thicker to include better optics.

For what they can do now, they could focus stack the photos when it detects that you are trying to take a photo of a flat sheet of paper, would take slightly longer to capture the image, but it would fix it completely.

Or they could do selective sharpening that takes into account the focus distance and the pattern of the blur at different distances, also would work.",3,1,GalaxyS23,151e45u,1,21,2023-07-17 10:29:03,Top

I matched up any aberrations I spotted in the images to the paper documents, be it caused by a crease in the page or the cheap printing from the financial institution. No obvious areas of blurred text, banana shaped or other.

I'm not saying the issue doesn't exist. The linked article concludes with the following:

""A software problem, on the other hand, seems unlikely, especially since not all Galaxy S23 or Galaxy S23+ users are affected, and of course it cannot be completely ruled out.""

The article speculates there could be a quality control problem. With S23s being assembled in at least three countries, and probably parts manufactured in several others, it's possible there could be an issue that could affect some units and not others.

Some have already received a new camera module from Samsung. Many are appalled and now want to have their smartphone repaired.  
The main camera's images are so bad, probably because of this bug. Background: the post-processing has to work the photo to death to get it sharp, but the images are destroyed in the process.

9070,S23 Base(256 GB) SoT,k3oqiov,hope89f,"Why is the subreddit so full of posts like this? When will you realize that SOT depends on WHAT you do with the screen on? WhatsApp has drained your battery in almost 2 hours of screen-on time, while YouTube (or any basic video playback) would have drained it in almost 3 hours.   
Some apps drains much more battery every certain number of minutes with the screen on compared to others, so SOT is always subjective. You can achieve 7-8 hours only if you do a lot of video playback or simple web browsing. Furthermore, the 7-8 hours you're talking about are valid for a total screen-on time of less than 16-20 hours, whereas in your screenshot, it's evident that the phone has been on for more than 24 hours in total.",3,1,GalaxyS23,170zzuj,1,12,2023-10-06 06:59:44,Top

You could get 7 hours SOT with a possibility total 100 to 0 drain happening in about 10 hrs. The more you fiddle with your phone, the faster the battery depletes irrespective of SOT, bacause there are other things happening in the background behind the screen as well.

The S23 is brighter in low light conditions but I'm this situation it sacrifices exposure for noise. However, in my practice, the S23 usually applies way too much noise reduction in low light and exposes for too long just to get a bad shot.

s23 looks better of the two right now. Because the detail on the carpet is not lost. Detail before the grain is important in photography. Because of those who want such smooth photos, Samsung has been processing photos like an oil painting effect for years.  
  
Don't expect completely grain-free photos at high ISOs from tiny sensors anymore. This is completely impossible. It is impossible even with a 1"" sensor. It can be corrected to a certain extent with artificial intelligence. But if you do too much, details elsewhere will be lost this time.

1. Music - If App opened ""Spotify"" Then Dolby Atmos ""On:Music"".
2. Streaming - If App opened ""Anything with video"" Then Motion smoothness ""Adaptive"" +   
Dolby Atmos ""On:Movie"".
3. Charging Sleep - If Charging status ""Wired charging"" Specific time ""9:00pm Every day"" Then Protect battery ""On"" + Fast charging ""Off"".
4. Charging Awake - If Charging status ""Wired charging"" Specific time ""6:30am Weekdays"" Then Protect battery ""Off"" + Fast charging ""On"".
5. Disable ""Always On Display"".
6. Enable ""Dark mode"".
7. Leave Home - If Place ""Leaving: My address"" Then Mobile data ""On"" + Bluetooth ""On"" + Wi-Fi ""Off"" + Brightness ""40"" + Motion smoothness ""Standard"" + Sound mode and volume Sound/40/40/40 + Media volume 40/40/40.
8. Arrive Home - If Place ""Arriving: My address"" Then Mobile data ""Off"" + Bluetooth ""Off"" + Wi-Fi ""On"" + Brightness ""40"" + Motion smoothness ""Standard"" + Sound mode and volume Sound/40/40/40 + Media volume 40/40/40.

Keep in mind Motion smoothness being set to standard = 60HZ, I only care about video streaming apps. I don't care when I'm browsing if it means I'll conserve more battery.

I disabled Always On Display because I've never used it and I'll conserve more battery.

The last Media volume is Bluetooth, set that to whatever you want but in my case I'll probably move it to 100 because my phone automatically pairs with my car and I control the volume from the stereo not the phone.

If you account for your remaining battery (20%) and the protect battery (15%) you've still got 35% unused, which would get you up to 6 hours SOT and 21 hours total. It's also worth noting that the S23 'over charges' at 100% so i reckon the 85-100% is actually worth like 20% rather than 15%.

That said, play services looks high, you can find plenty of posts on here about reducing it (clear app install optimisation and clearing cache). If you used smart switch I would recommend a clean install as I've found it makes a difference.

The other thing is you've had your phone a day, likely you've been battering in with installs and updates, and it hasn't had a chance to learn your usage patterns. Give it a week and it should be fine",3,1,GalaxyS23,123c8x1,0,11,2023-03-27 06:39:38,Top

Samsung has better camera, software support, accessories, UI customization, slimmer, larger display while same proportions, significantly higher peak brightness, armoured aluminium frame, faster usb port and higher procesor clock speed.

Only thing ZenFone is better at is selfie cam resolution, 10% paperly higher battery and jack. Selfie res doesn't mean it's better, jack can be added though 5$ cable and Samsung battery management is next level cause it's impossible for me to kill it within one day (averaging around 8+ hours while having everything on).

I wouldn't even consider ZenFone cause there is no reason to unless you're brand fan.

Edit: I'm not Samsung enthusiast. S23 is my first Samsung device. I tend to buy the best and don't care about brand.",11,0,GalaxyS23,16qfik7,0,37,2023-09-23 22:07:39,Top

This is just going by paper specs:

  
S23 display is much brighter, its also one of Samsung's best display.

\- Dynamic AMOLED 2X adaptive 120Hz (vs. Super AMOLED 120MHz/144Hz game)

S23 has telephoto camera lens.

S23 uses USB-C 3.2 (vs. USB-C 2.0)

&#x200B;

Z10 has 3.5mm jack.

Z10 has band 7 for WiFi

Z10 has side mount fingerprint reader (vs. On screen)

Z10 has larger 4300 mAh battery (vs. 3900 mAh)

&#x200B;

\^ So really these are the only thing that stands out. So if any of those pertain to you.

Now for the nitty gritty. 

OS Updates:

S3: 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> 17 (5 years security updates)

Z10: 13 -> 14 -> 15 (4 years security updates)

So you'll get longer support from Samsung. Not sure how ASUS does their phone warranty but you get 1 year with Samsung and they fix it for free.

&#x200B;

If you want more battery life on the S23 just set it to Light Profile.

[https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/mobile-devices/how-to-use-galaxy-s23-light-mode/](https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/mobile-devices/how-to-use-galaxy-s23-light-mode/)

On my S23U I can get about 8\~ hours SOT (non gaming) while using WiFi and have 15% left.

So if any of the listed above makes you lean towards more on one than the other then thats entirely up to you. Everyone has their needs and wants from a mobile device.",8,2,GalaxyS23,16qfik7,0,37,2023-09-23 22:36:57,Top

You may only see a 3.5mm port from the outside, but the full size of the headphone jack component is pretty massive relative to the size of the phone itself. So the question is, what did they leave out in order to free up that much internal volume? They had to cut corners somewhere in order to make that much internal real estate available. 

There is a reason why only larger form factor electronics still have a headphone jack. There just isn't enough room in a modern phone to fit the jack without leaving something else out - and whatever they left out is far more valuable spec wise than the headphone jack. 

The inclusion of a headphone jack in phones is a manufacturers way of cheaping out on the build in such a way as to convince you that the cheaper component is somehow more valuable to your long term use of the phone. 

Stick with the higher spec phone and buy a DAC if wired audio is that important to you. A DAC will have higher quality audio than a 3.5mm headphone jack anyway.",2,0,GalaxyS23,16qfik7,0,37,2023-09-24 17:20:41,Top

9387,it's shocking how close the gap between smartphones and apsc cameras have become,jg34df8,None,"If you want subscribers for your YouTube channel you might try pitching that to people and coming up with real content.  As it stands, this is just yet another ""I'm YouTube expert who is not really an expert"" posts. Simply put, it is embarrasing and conveys either ignorance of the two devices or an intent to misrepresent them.  Yes, I am a photographer and have long since lost patience with this crap.   

1) The A6400 is a 3+ year old camera with industry trailing IQ for stills paired with a very basic bargain/bundle lens.  As for the camera, it was never more than average, with stills IQ that could not match cameras literally produced half a decade earlier.  Vloggers seemed to like it which makes sense given its size, above average video (for its time), and idiot level controls.  

2) The A6400 is such an advanced camera that it can be gotten new (with lens) for around the price of a S23 Ultra. Yes, that is sarcasm. That speaks to entry level old device. BTW, body only is less and price with a lens depends upon your bundle. If anyone is in the market, don't buy it.  Again, it was average (at best) for its time and is not worth even its discounted price today.    

3) The photos posted demonstrate either intent to push the phone or a singular lack of skills with an ILC device.  I will leave others to decide which actually applies.  

4) Both cameras in your hand could do better than your ""test"" shots, as could just about any (non-bargain bin) phone since at least 2017 or 2018.   That, however, does mean any phone is a match for any DSLR or ILC device.  It means crappy point and shoot images look like crappy point and shoot images when you compare a point and shoot camera to a DSLR or ILC being used like a point and shoot camera.  

5) You obviously have no clue what it means to have a larger sensor with larger photosites (look up light capture, shadow recovery, highlight clipping, etc., etc.).  The same applies to variable aperture ILC lenses, although you did pick an idiot level ILC that makes it difficult to change shutter speed and aperture, so perhaps you don't fully grasp the point of real camera features in the first place.   

A good photographer can take a quality image with any camera you put in their hands.  Unfortunately the reverse is also always true.  A bad photographer, or one trying to make a point, can take bad images with a Nikon Z9 or Hasselblad X1D.  What you have demonstrated is that crappy shots look equally crappy on a point and shoot and (entry level) ILC.  It says next to nothing about either device and everything about either your skill level or intent.",17,0,GalaxyS23,12kjday,0,1,2023-04-13 12:38:57,Top

I don't have any evidence of this but in my experience working at AT&T and having been a long time galaxy user, it seems that non-Samsung devices (headphones, chargers, adapters, etc) break after so long. I've personally had to replace 4 or 5 audio adapters for the aux cord in my car so I feel your pain. That being said, none of my Samsung products have ever had any issues. I have galaxy buds 2 pro (which I know you don't like wireless, but I still recommend at least trying. They're very comfortable in the ear and good quality), a 65W Samsung charging block and Samsung cords. Charges anything plugged in quick AF and no issues.

9472,New phone only 5 hours of screen time from 100% to 20% by only web browsing,jjgmvo4,ccaymmud,"1. don't use chrome. fatal mistake. shit browser. Use Samsung's internet browser. it's much better.
2. uninstall facebook and all its crap. It's spyware that hides its battery usage. And FB loves to track which apps you use, which sites you look at, how long you open each page, etc.
3. Don't have twitter running in the background. Similar to #2. Getting 1000 notifications in 5 hours means your phone is running twitter in the background constantly to get those notifications.
4. Tiktok in the background drains battery too...
5. make sure your connection is set to LTE only, no 5G. If you enable 5G your battery life will automatically be about 40% shorter. That's coz 5G sux.
6. That said, 5 hours of web browsing in bright sunlight will drain the battery much faster as the phone is boosted to max brightness.

My 5 hour SOT playing Genshin Impact takes only about 60% to 70% of battery life, so I'm pretty sure the phone battery is solid.

9533,My experience switching from iPhone 13 to Galaxy S23,k2o80yv,GGmyBOYS,"So, a thing that I don't agree with is the smoothness between switching the apps. So if u scroll apple and samsung side by side at 120hz, apple will be slower. So the catch here is that apple has slowed down Annimations to make u think it's smoother, whereas it's just slower. If u increase the animations time on the Samsung, expect no less. 

Second thing, transferring from Samsung to Samsung is fluent like it is apple to apple. It's more like an apple problem that they choose to keep their ecosystem more restricted bcoz Samsung can fluently transfer to other android devices as well by Nearby Share and other such services. 

Third, I think it should've been pretty obvious for the wallet which one u would be better off using or should be using, which is obviously having Samsung in it's name, but u can use the other one as well. There are no restrictions to either

Fourth, I don't think a learning curve is a con or the features that are provided. If u think it's a con, I would rather suggest switching back over to IOS with hardly any features and opportunities to customize anything at all.

Overall, I think these are more of personal problems that u are facing. If u don't want to learn or use features or u don't know what to do, it's more of a you problem rather than the cons of a device. Also, if ur family is with apple, it's ur personal problem as well. My family is much more understanding and I ask them to use Google Meet or Whatsapp, which give a rather good quality video which is far away from blurry. 

Also, u obviously will get some perks when u use a device with a single company manufactured component and apps because they are tailored specifically for the device, whereas apps that u use on Samsung are used by every type of android device ranging from Xiaomi to Motorola",16,1,GalaxyS23,16uw989,19,53,2023-09-29 02:53:48,Top
9534,My experience switching from iPhone 13 to Galaxy S23,k2od4j4,Macguyver76,"There's a lot you're doing wrong here and it's not your fault it's just a learning curve.  You can't be on iOS for years and expect to figure everything out on Samsung right away and Samsung Android is very different from Pixel Android.  A few of your gripes are handled natively on the pixel like voicemail, Google wallet and password manager.  However Samsung has the best hardware on Android, but Samsung has more of a kitchen sink approach to software.  There're a ton of options and once you have things set how you like them it's a good experience, it will take time. I've been on Samsung and pixel for years so to me the settings menus are very intuitive and I know them well.  When I have to find something on iOS on my wife's phone or one of the kid's devices I find it an absolute mess and it pisses me off lol.

Here's some tips off the top of my head.  If you don't have a Gmail account get one and sign into it on the phone, if you have one sign into it.  Log into chrome on it and make sure the password manager is setup.  Then search auto fill in the phone settings and set the Google password manager to default and then go to Google in the settings and make sure it's syncing.  Uninstall or disable the Samsung one.  Download and setup Google wallet, turn on NFC and use tap to pay.  It works everywhere apple pay does and it's never accidentally triggered for me.  

The voicemail situation kinda sucks but it is what it is, it works like an iPhone on the pixel but never as on Samsung and other carriers.  There are some decent third party apps.  I personally disabled or uninstalled a lot of the Samsung apps.  I use the Google calendar, messages, keep, Gboard, wallet etc.  It's generally a better experience.  As for the degraded pics and video, well that's apple keeping a stranglehold on their lock in strategy and intentionally degrading pics and video to get people to think other platforms are inferior when we have all the same features and more but they don't want the iPhone user base to know that.  Sending via RCS from Android to Android phone works like iMessage, no degradation and it's encrypted.

I think some of your challenges may be country specific / perceptions. I'm presuming you are in the USA. For instance:  
""Everyone else has iPhone""  
""Apple Pay. Seems more secure, widespread, intuitive, and works""  
  
Here in UK/EU these don't hold true. Everyone uses WhatsApp. G Pay is the same as Apple Pay which is the same as using a debit or creidt card to the retailer in that it's contactless. G Pay is seamless, if it's fast enough to get you through a tube turnstile at rush hour that means it's fast :-)  
  
NFT: ""Doesn't seem secure at all. I've turned off the NFT feature so that I don't accidentally walk by and pay for something I don't want"".  
Ignoring the phone needs to be on etc, this is a common misunderstanding/urban legend from decades ago. Contactless and chip & pin have been around for ages. Your comment is the equivalent of saying eveyone with a debit or credit card (all here have contactless/NFC) needs to put them in a shieled wallet or Faraday cage in case of accidentaly paying for something.

9548,My experience switching from iPhone 13 to Galaxy S23,k2rmx5v,Zytose,"As others have mentioned it does just seem like a learning curve. I suppose in short iphone is an easy to use get the job done device that anyone can learn to use in an evening. Android will allow further personalisation and functionality but you'll keep finding features you didn't know existed.

If it makes you feel any better regarding gwallet (Which I use) you can't acually use it unless your phone meets google's safety and security standards. Out the box these standards are met but if the software is tampered with i.e modified OS then the wallet will be disabled. Users like myself on the s23 One UI6 beta will know this very well because even though it's samsung provided, google disables the wallet until full release.

Regarding the video problem, typically if one enters full screen it is implied that you want to watch it horizontally, otherwise why are you bothering, just watch it as is. I can't say i've had the problem of changing rotation. only thing I can think of is you have it locked and accidently pressing the rotation button.

I don't bother with the samsung password thing, most apps keep me signed in so I have no use for it. regarding bank details I never store them. It's a personal choice though.

The fingerprint sensor is a problem I had run into myself admittedly, I think it was because of some screen protectors I bought previously so I tried another brand and these ones seem to work better and don't give me any problems getting in now. Only advice on this is try to get tempered glass and from a reputible brand if possible.

That sets it apart from Google Drive. The other person doesn't need Dropbox to open the link. Well, they probably should get it if you want them to share clear pictures and videos with you. 

I partially agree with your case/fingerprint issue with the androids. BUT, you really just need a thin case that protects the backside and edges of your phone. You don't need a fancy case that completely enclosed it rendering the fingerprint useless. I found one screen protector that actually works with fingerprint 90% of the time. I can share info if you need it. 

As for the password generator, I would just download 1password because it's amazing and top notch. It has password generator, fingerprint unlock, a security key to encrypt your entire account, AND a bonus feature which I LOVE is their 2 factor authentication feature that is built in the app. You can copy it from an extension in your browser and log in super fast. This is why I will be a customer for life.

Two years ago, I got Samsung S20 FE for work phone.  And I have being using both Samsung and iPhone (Xs Max) concurrently. 

First, 13 days is difficult to make assessment on iOS vs Android.  It takes a longer to get used to the new OS and then being able to make unbiased assessment.

On the issues that you have.  If it doesn't work, then return it while you still have time.  Everyone has their own preferences.  In general, Apple iOS is just more polished.  So it works for like 90% of people.  But if it doesn't work with the remaining 10%, there is nothing user can do about it.  On other hand, Android has a lot of customization, so everyone can probably find the setting that works for them.  But some of the things you mentioned are HW or firmware related, so not user modify-able.

Weak vibration: I agree.  Also issue on my S20 FE.  I have to turn on ring tone when I'm outside so I don't miss calls.

Notification system: S23+ has AOD (always on display).  If you turn that on, I believe that should address the notification when screen is off issue.  Does detailed notification work together with AOD? (I don't know.  Something to test out).

Camera processing: There is a lot of competition on Android side.  Companies are trying to stand out with their phone.  That means both features and post processing.  On the other side, Apple just take the middle of the road approach on processing and features.  Then other factor is personal preference: sharpness, brightness, white balance.  For example, Pixel 7 tend to sharpen, whereas S23+ tend to soften.

Alternative is to try Pro Mode and also Expert Raw.  Pro Mode give you more control.  Expert RAW should address the overprocessing issue, but then you need to work with RAW file.",2,1,GalaxyS23,134m40y,4,21,2023-05-01 16:35:17,Top

You can also enable CPU responsiveness through ADB:

You will need [Samsung USB Driver](https://developer.samsung.com/android-usb-driver).

You can get [ADB](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip) directly from Google.

I also suggest you debloat your device. [Here](https://files.catbox.moe/rcdh3q.txt) is a list of [packages](https://files.catbox.moe/rqn169.jpg) you can easily disable. [Here](https://files.catbox.moe/08rfyx.txt) is the same list with the right command to disable them appended in front of each package (easy copy/paste job).

Camera upgrade, significant video quality and stabilization upgrade, Insane battery upgrade, significant speakers upgrade, huge storage speed upgrade, more convenient for holding design, front facing camera upgrade, significantly better chip.

This topic is very often misunderstood, and a lot of people are repeating the same damn thing - ""depth of field"". Depth of field might be mentioned when talking about those pictures, where **one subject is in focus, and background subjects (in distance!), are out of focus**. This is depth of field in short (there are more details about this to fully explain the topic, like aperture etc, but let's skip those details). In my opinion, problem with S23/S23+ is **caused by defective lens** (or it's installation?). 

In S23/S23+ some areas of picture are **always slightly out of focus \[1\]**. Depending on what we're photographing it might be minor issue or big issue. With close-up photos it's rather big issue because it's way easier to notice blurry areas than on landscape photos let's say. On my unit close-up photos look just bad, you don't really have to try hard, you just see that picture is blurry - focus point is super sharp, but the rest of the photo is very blurry...

9920,New case,jcyn2km,manhducdm,"2 years ago I got myself a rinoshield case for my galaxy S10 after keeping the official silicone case for a year. I quite liked the silicone case but it really isn't that durable it was pretty beaten up from just getting in and out of my pocket. When I switched to the rinoshield one the first thing I noticed was the ""bulkiness"" of it. It wasn't a bad thing but keep in mind it is nowhere near as sleek as the silicone one. But I have to say it's build like a tank. It can withstand any day to day threat and still looks good as new after 2 years. I think it's worth it considering you won't need to change case beside the maybe time to time ""relooking"". Also the designs are gorgeous so go for it. 

For the moment I got myself a leather case for me S23U and I'm quite pleased with it. I'm thinking to get a rinoshield case during some sales but no hurry. 

PS : You could scout the internet for some promo code. French speaking youtubers quite often get sponsored. But I have to say these days there is a lot of competition in the case maket so it's more difficult to find one.",3,1,GalaxyS23,11wlhh4,1,2,2023-03-20 15:49:32,Top

10058,"Shutter Lag, Banan Blur questions",jwqqef1,cdegallo,"1.  It's shutter speed if you're worried about subject motion blur in shots.  Shutter lag is the gap in time between when you press the shutter button and when the frame is captured.  For shutter lag, Samsung improved this and also has tweaks that you can use in the Camera Assistant module that further-reduces shutter lag (at the potential cost of photo quality; personally I have not noticed any reduction in quality).  I haven't had issues with shutter lag and snapping the shot I expect at the time I expect.  Shutter speed and subject motion blur hasn't really gotten a meaningful change as far as my S23 ultra goes--but I will say that having used an S21 ultra most recently, it is better.  I also used a pixel 7 pro recently and have a spastic son--I'll be honest, at this point I don't really run into any differences between them and subject motion blur.  I used to be a huge stickler about subject motion blur, but I have no qualms with my S23 ultra in that regard.

2.  I also have an S23 and have not had the banana pattern blur on either the S23 or ultra.  AFAIK Samsung hasn't acknowledged this specific issue, only a general focus issue (which was in the August update release notes).",1,1,GalaxyS23,15ul0b8,0,9,2023-08-18 16:44:04,Top

I enjoy the fluidity of iOS, but get bored of it pretty quickly.  I am a software dev and I like to tinker and customize it.

Face unlock on the S23 series won't be as good as FaceID because it is just using the front facing camera and doesn't have IR sensors, etc.  I found that it works pretty good if I hold it at a stable distance away during both the setup of face unlock and when trying to unlock with it.  The first week or so I was probably at 50-60% success rate with it, but now I'd say I'm around 90-95%, so good enough for me!

The fingerprint sensor on the S23 series is really good IMO.  MUCH better than the Pixel 7 series.  

If you want a really simple and clean interface, try other launchers.  I am currently using Niagara launcher and while I can't customize it as much as I want, I have to admit it is really fluid and simple to use once you take a few days to get used to it.

Good news it that it is symmetric, instead of off axis.  The ring is more of a problem, because in real life photography, there are subjects in this area.  The real proof is if you can observe or notice the softness in that ring, in real life photography.  In the other examples posted only, the blur is observable, even in landscape photography where subject and focus is far away.  To me that is not acceptable.

10221,Comparison BananaGate April Update vs June Update,jp6a3ax,None,"In my opinion, this isn't banana gate since I believe you only experience this in close up shots (like taking a picture of a piece of paper). This isn't the camera's fault. The main lens is simply not designed to click close up shots like the one you tried to click.
But if you try to click the same picture using the 3x lens, you'll see that the picture comes out perfect. That's because the 3x lens is designed to take close up shots.So, the problem isn't the main camera, the problem is most people using the wrong lens to click close up shots and then confusing it as banana gate. If your
phone had banana gate issue, you'd see that the blur appears in ALL the pictures you click using the main camera (not just close up shots). Also, if your phone had banana gate, the blurred text would be practically unreadable. So, something to consider is - does ALL your pictures have a blur around that area?

Also, the international model has an Exynos chip, steer that shit clear from me please, snapdragon all the way.

EDIT: Just watched one comparison video and I confirm what this guy says in this post is absolute bollocks.

https://youtu.be/TWDOkT_fTJU

The A54 is nowhere near as good as the S23. some very notable differences:

1- Screen brightness: 1000 Nits vs 1750 Nits maximum

2- Fingerprint scanner: Optical vs Ultrasonic (at least 2x faster on the S23)

3- Storage speed: UFS 2.0 vs UFS 4.0 (around 4x more speed)

4- Chipset: Exynos 1380 vs SD 8 Gen 2 (500k vs 1200k Antutu score), the Exynos is an absolute mess when it comes to efficiency

5- Lack of optical image stabilization on the A54, and smaller camera lenses

6- Much better camera quality on the S23 (Watch the video I linked)

7- No wireless / Rev wireless charging on the A54

8- Plastic vs Metal frame

10436,Do you think Samsung will extend update for S23,k8tdkna,Broder7937,"4 year update policy was introduced with S21 FE, so previous to S22. 4 years is plenty if you buy the phone at launch. Guess what, most people don't. The problem with 4 years is that many people will buy the phone one or even two years after launch. For example, I know many people who are now getting the S21 FE (especially as, now that the S23 FE is out, S21 FE prices are rapidly dropping). When the S21 FE first came out with Android 12, going all the way up to Android 16 felt like great longevity (especially given its predecessor, the S20 FE, already stopped on Android 13). But now that we're already on Android 14, Android 16 doesn't seem that far away, it's literally just two OS updates away. I usually keep my phones for, at least, 3 years, and I'll go past 4 years if I can. I take extreme good care of my devices and my battery, so I can stay that long with my phones. If I get a phone that's already 2 years old, I'll run out of OS updates before I switch my phone. Sure, I can just run the older OS, but we all know it's not the same thing. Software today is just as, if not more, important than hardware.

So no, 4 OS updates isn't really that much. And also, no. I don't think Samsung is changing that for the S23. If they ever change it, I'll be valid for future models only and won't retroactively apply to older models, just like the S20 FE is not getting Android 14, despite the fact Samsung still sells the S20 FE.",1,0,GalaxyS23,17spk3i,0,10,2023-11-11 18:18:29,Top

Edit : it also has a bass tuner, here's the description:

Bass tuner¬∂
Bass tuner allows you to set a very precise bass boost or reduction. This can be useful if your speaker system has a resonant peak in the lower frequencies or a point where long soundwaves cancel each other out.

Bass type Allows you to choose between natural, transient compressor and sustain compressor types. The transient compressor adds the possibility to increase or decrease the initial bass punch. The sustain compressor preserves the transient and is able to increase or reduce the rumble. This can be used to reduce resonance without compromising the initial kick or to make balanced armature drivers sound less anemic.

Buds 2 Pro and Buds 2 are superior in every way.
AirPods Pro is a bit more superior in comfort because it stays on the tip of the ear instead of going inside the ears, this way you forget you were wearing them, Whereas you can feel Samsung's Buds but very comfortable.
Anyway, Buds 2 is comfortable and tiny compared to the others I tried. I wouldn't recommend AirPods Pro for sound quality, only just for the comfort and Transparency mode. Apple also has very responsive feeling Spatial Audio (360 Audio) compared to Samsung's B- implementation of it.
Samsung on stock EQ is way better sounding, Apple on stock EQ sounds a bit backseated (AirPods Pro Gen 1).

Step 1) only press the options given. (.6 , 1x ,  3 , 10,)  although yes you can still zoom from there , it will look okay.. until for example you get past 30 and decide to use 100 zoom (30 is a sub option you can choose after you first choose 10 , when given the options between .6 , 1x ,  3 , & 10) 

2) You have to figure out the Zoom levels and when to not pass too far in each ""sub category"" in order to keep quality at its best. Example; yes you can go to 100zoom, but are you really going to for a photo ? No. Only to see farther. Stay at 30 and it's actually all you'll need, even at 100 zoom, things can end up looking fine, just not ideal. But say you try to reach some where similar to how 100 is far fetched FROM option 3 (even though it's not possible to reach 100 zoom using 3 or 1x.. , the principle is the same) ..... instead of coming from 10 first and THEN zooming to 30 or 100 (again not possible to reach from that camera level until choosing 10, but still the same idea of : expanding that individual camera too far)

So we get the idea what are you talking about. 

Do you have any camera lens protector on? Or case that has camera protector built into it? Because i have seen those when i was looking to buy a case. 

I just upgraded to S23 Ultra few days ago, and I also have iPhone 12 Pro alongside my S23 Ultra. Camera is doing just fine on my phone. 

To say that you like the iPhone photos better is a matter of prefference, totally fine.. but if you say your previous S22U photos better is a little concerning.. either you may have the wrong settings (since its a new phone maybe you played around with the settings, etc).. or your camera lens have some sort of protectors on.. or your S23U is faulty. You may try raise your concern to Samsung or BestBuy so you can exchange to another S23U unit. 
In my country, if a unit is faulty within 14 days of purchase, Samsung will replace your phone with a new one, regardless from which store you bought it from. 

I am not familiar with BestBuy policy, does exchange will also be charged with restocking fee? If not you can exchange it, see if the phone was indeed faulty, and if the new camera does differently for a couple of days. If you are still not happy, then return it and stay with your S22U until iPhone 15 came out in a few months.

* in your default camera app, go to the ""Pro"" mode (it might be in your ""More"" settings if you scroll to the right, you can drag it into your regular camera scroll bar), and mess around with the manual settings.

10872,Need Suggestions,k4wwvyw,Traditional-Skill-,"Something that could help your situation is to Go into both galaxy/Google app store settings and don't let it update until you want to get them to update (it's what I do) you don't need every single update every single day. Updating the ""available"" apps twice a week or so is just fine unless you're waiting for a specific featire that's about to be integrated in to a certain app you use and since you update twice a week you'll still get it  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. These days if an app has an urgent or mandatory update the app will even prompt you to do it like today when I opened up Twitter It took me to the store to update it.

Second you have the S23 base with the smallest battery in the series. I'd recommend turning off protect battery, it makes less sense to cut short your battery life like that. I have the s23 ultra which has the biggest battery out of the series and I keep protect battery off but do something else. What I do is never let the phone charge to 100% but depending on the use I want to get ill charge anywhere from 90-92-95-97, no more than that. It may ""save the battery"" a bit less but there is still some protection since it doesn't ever reach 100. Either way Samsung makes their parts more available now and anyone with a 3+ year old phone (around the time where you noticed real bad battery degradation) can replace their battery easier and cheaper now than before. It's actually the recommended option for people after having a phone for so long. Fresh Battery and it's wayyy cheaper than upgrading. iPhone users do it all the time at through the apple store.

Another suggestion, go to Settings ‚ÜíBattery Device and Care‚ÜíBattery‚ÜíBackground Usage Limits‚ÜíDeep Sleeping Apps‚ÜíPress the (+) sign on the top right, & start checking off all the apps that you KNOW that you do not use ""Daily/Weekly"" at all. We all have so many apps not all of them have to be active. The phone will force Deep Sleep those anyways eventually by itself of course but that's overrr time, this will help speed up that process as you're helping it along. The apps will wake up when you need to use them on whatever occasion. 

After that you're in that setting you can check your ""always active apps"" and Selectively turn ""some"" of those into the First ""Sleep"" option under ""Background Usage limits"". I don't recommend you taking any out of there that you would want fast notifications from that have to do with Communication like texting, social media, video chatting, & things like Amazon because otherwise their can be delays in you getting notifications from those apps, but for me to give you an example apps like the ""Google"" app, ""book reading apps"" ""bedbath& beyond"", ""video streaming apps"" like Netflix, Hulu, Disney plus that a delayed notification doesn't really matter at all.

10907,Should i switch from the iphone 13,jxz8pqi,veerusayz,"I think I'm the right person to answer your question as I recently switched from iPhone 13 to S23. 

My observations

1. Slightly better memory management in S23. It means most of the apps are stored in memory and they can be retrieved at any time.

2. Performance is same, despite 120hz refresh rate I didn't feel significant difference in scrolling. 

3. Cameras are slightly better in S23.

4. Battery life and consistency is better in iPhone 13. 

5. S23 can be operated with single hand much conveniently compared to iPhone 13. 

6. Display is more or less same. However, s23 has prominently highest display limit.

7. Animations and haptics are better in iPhone 13. 
I think it may not be a good idea to switch to s23 considering the price difference.",1,1,GalaxyS23,1623itg,1,20,2023-08-27 16:55:19,Top

2) The exposure changes depending on what you're focusing on and metering mode. Since this is out of focus, it looks like the camera averaged the scene and made it brighter.

To achieve what you're thinking, you could've focused on the houses/buildings just below where the sun dipped which will underexpose the sky and give it a dramatic look.

10943,Help me decide between 13 pro or s23 base ;(,jdrkfr3,jmydy,"I was using iPhone 13 pro a year ago and S23 this year. 

iPhone was delivering more premium feel, because of nicer screen and superb haptics. Call quality was great also on loudspeaker. It was much heavier and not so comfortable to hold without case because of frame design. Battery life was good too. Cameras were very good. 

I didn't like the iOS as it was lacking simple things in comparison to Android. As non-US customer I didn't like how iOS was forcing me to use Apple Maps. I prefer Google Maps. iOS was complaining all the time it wants Apple Maps. There was something wrong with how animations were implemented. There was occasional stuttering. So despite 120Hz it wasn't operating buttery smooth.

S23 is lighter and has perfect form factor. I really appreciate it's quite small and light. It's display will look washed out in comparison to iphone (well, it looks washed out compared to some cheaper Samsung phones). It's very bright though. So just check it yourself maybe my eyes are very picky about colors:) Cameras didn't impress me that much and there is too much of postprocessing, quite often photos look artificial. Haptics as well. It's just not iPhone level. It operates super smooth, Snapdragon 8gen2 is super fast. It has good battery life. Overall very good phone but display is not 10/10.

Side note: both are very pricey in my country but S23 is bit cheaper. Well tbh I just checked and I can't find new 13 pro anymore... Regarding Samsung - be aware that you should pick 256gb version as it has faster UFS 4.0 storage. I like Samsung OneUI and I think it goes in right direction. I would buy S23 (from outlet). It's new model so you'll get few years of updates. And as I mentioned it's comfortable to use so it's what you need. But... You might like iPhone cameras more.

Your issue is a question to see IF it would burn on YOUR phone specifically bc you are using a device that is faulty or a network that is having extremely serious issues.

Is Samsung Mobile affected by image burn-in phenomenon?

Last Update date :¬†Aug 03. 2022

As Samsung applied internal software algorithm to prevent image burn-in phenomenon, Samsung Mobile Devices such as Galaxy Note9, S9/S9+ and A8/A8+ are not affected by it.

¬†¬†¬†¬†
Samsung designed a new UX around the Infinity Display¬π¬† to offer a more natural user experience.

11253,Is the banana gate still on S23?,jqiopkq,catalinus,"Bananagate is a very specific issue and not all S23 units have it, in fact possibly less than 10% of them have it.

True ""bananagate"" is when you take a picture of a flat object (like a newspaper) at a decent distance (at least 0.5m) and while you have the phone steady and perfectly parallel to the subject the resulting picture has one or more zones (possibly with a weird shape like a banana) that are out of focus while most of the picture is sharp.

This is different than depth-of-field focus results (which too often are reported as ""bananagate"" by people that do not understand depth-of-field), also different than minimal focus distance issues (which again people misreport often).

I did get last week a base S23/256 in EU for a member of the family and it did not have any ""bananagate"" problems, but when you are not very careful with your composition and you expect too much (and also you do not activate ""Prioritize focus over speed"" in Camera Assistant) you get pictures where you get to see depth-of-field focus issues.

I don't know how this isn't mentioned in any review, maybe people need glasses or something I really don't get it, it's like reviewers just gave them a pass, and not just to Samsung, other brands also do this, we are going backwards.

The phone excels in every other aspect tho. I hate curved screens and like the size of the S23+ but I regret not getting the Ultra because the pentile screen makes it look cheap af.
