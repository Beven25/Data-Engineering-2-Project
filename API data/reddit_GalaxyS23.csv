209,it's shocking how close the gap between smartphones and apsc cameras have become,jg34df8,None,"If you want subscribers for your YouTube channel you might try pitching that to people and coming up with real content.  As it stands, this is just yet another ""I'm YouTube expert who is not really an expert"" posts. Simply put, it is embarrasing and conveys either ignorance of the two devices or an intent to misrepresent them.  Yes, I am a photographer and have long since lost patience with this crap.   

1) The A6400 is a 3+ year old camera with industry trailing IQ for stills paired with a very basic bargain/bundle lens.  As for the camera, it was never more than average, with stills IQ that could not match cameras literally produced half a decade earlier.  Vloggers seemed to like it which makes sense given its size, above average video (for its time), and idiot level controls.  

2) The A6400 is such an advanced camera that it can be gotten new (with lens) for around the price of a S23 Ultra. Yes, that is sarcasm. That speaks to entry level old device. BTW, body only is less and price with a lens depends upon your bundle. If anyone is in the market, don't buy it.  Again, it was average (at best) for its time and is not worth even its discounted price today.    

3) The photos posted demonstrate either intent to push the phone or a singular lack of skills with an ILC device.  I will leave others to decide which actually applies.  

4) Both cameras in your hand could do better than your ""test"" shots, as could just about any (non-bargain bin) phone since at least 2017 or 2018.   That, however, does mean any phone is a match for any DSLR or ILC device.  It means crappy point and shoot images look like crappy point and shoot images when you compare a point and shoot camera to a DSLR or ILC being used like a point and shoot camera.  

5) You obviously have no clue what it means to have a larger sensor with larger photosites (look up light capture, shadow recovery, highlight clipping, etc., etc.).  The same applies to variable aperture ILC lenses, although you did pick an idiot level ILC that makes it difficult to change shutter speed and aperture, so perhaps you don't fully grasp the point of real camera features in the first place.   

A good photographer can take a quality image with any camera you put in their hands.  Unfortunately the reverse is also always true.  A bad photographer, or one trying to make a point, can take bad images with a Nikon Z9 or Hasselblad X1D.  What you have demonstrated is that crappy shots look equally crappy on a point and shoot and (entry level) ILC.

Companies like to say all day because they assume a person is gonna be running one app at a time, no apps in the background, battery saver, and doesn't touch their screen (so the screen can drop down to 1 or 48hz) and the lowest brightness. It also depends on environment, 5g, 4g or wifi (range and stability are also important.

293,New case,jcyn2km,manhducdm,"2 years ago I got myself a rinoshield case for my galaxy S10 after keeping the official silicone case for a year. I quite liked the silicone case but it really isn't that durable it was pretty beaten up from just getting in and out of my pocket. When I switched to the rinoshield one the first thing I noticed was the ""bulkiness"" of it. It wasn't a bad thing but keep in mind it is nowhere near as sleek as the silicone one. But I have to say it's build like a tank. It can withstand any day to day threat and still looks good as new after 2 years. I think it's worth it considering you won't need to change case beside the maybe time to time ""relooking"". Also the designs are gorgeous so go for it. 

For the moment I got myself a leather case for me S23U and I'm quite pleased with it. I'm thinking to get a rinoshield case during some sales but no hurry.

332,S23+ - All the issues I encountered in 13 days of ownership.,jifg18z,r_slash_jarmedia,"honestly, a lot of these issues are just things that are going to be different when compared to any iPhone. the vibration motor is a tough one because since Apple started using the ""Taptic Engine"" in the iPhone 7 series, no phone on the market has come close to the iPhone in terms of haptics. missing a lot of notifications isn't unusual on these phones because Sammy has switched to a different-axis motor in recent generations which makes touch haptics feel better but makes it harder to notice vibrations when your phone is on a surface or in your pocket. the notifications just behave different on Android in general, they don't wake the screen but I believe some 3rd party apps allow you to do that, or you can use edge lighting to see a popup of the app, though that won't be the same as waking your whole lockscreen. the ""heavy processing"" of pictures can be avoided by changing settings, playing around with camera modes, disabling ""scene optimizer"", etc. as for the camera's ""bananagate"", unfortunately that's a hardware problem that you can't do much about, though the focus ""issues"" aren't really issues, they're the downsides of a bigger primary sensor. a lot of those focus issues would be resolved if you just move your phone further away from your subject when trying to snap a photo. hope this helps out in some way (:",7,0,0,GalaxyS23,134m40y,4,21,2023-05-01 13:28:00,Top

If it's part of a monthly plan then I don't think you can use the eSIM without unlocking unless you can manage to talk it out and tell them it's going to be used just for international travel but I doubt it since there is no partial way and also any possibility of them knowing if you really went abroad or not.

  
The SIM to eSIM is just a transfer on the Verizon side if they support the eSIM. So you just need to visit a Verizon store or maybe you can do it over their website if they have a client tool for that. 

>  
do typical International services all support the use of eSIMs these days, and should I therefore simply keep the eSIM available for future use?

That depends where you are going. Some countries might have just SIM and some will have SIM and eSIM.

Here in Mexico the eSIM is getting pretty popular but in the cheap *MVNO* cause you get the eSIM with some data for really cheap and then you port the number to another company for benefits and then repeat once the benefits end in company 1.

However, the biggest company in the country (Telcel) will only hand you an eSIM if you get a monthly plan. AT&T sometimes allows you to get one but that depends of the store and the guys that work in that particular store.

  
One thing to notice. I don't remember having the eSIM option like that when I had a locked phone so chances are big that your phone is unlocked if I'm not mistaken.",3,0,0,GalaxyS23,18b3wz8,2,7,2023-12-05 05:06:57,Top

364,Comparison BananaGate April Update vs June Update,jp6a3ax,None,"In my opinion, this isn't banana gate since I believe you only experience this in close up shots (like taking a picture of a piece of paper). This isn't the camera's fault. The main lens is simply not designed to click close up shots like the one you tried to click.
But if you try to click the same picture using the 3x lens, you'll see that the picture comes out perfect. That's because the 3x lens is designed to take close up shots.So, the problem isn't the main camera, the problem is most people using the wrong lens to click close up shots and then confusing it as banana gate. If your
phone had banana gate issue, you'd see that the blur appears in ALL the pictures you click using the main camera (not just close up shots). Also, if your phone had banana gate, the blurred text would be practically unreadable. So, something to consider is - does ALL your pictures have a blur around that area? 

TL;DR - Your phone is fine. Just use the 3x lens to click

https://youtu.be/TWDOkT_fTJU

The A54 is nowhere near as good as the S23. some very notable differences:

1- Screen brightness: 1000 Nits vs 1750 Nits maximum

2- Fingerprint scanner: Optical vs Ultrasonic (at least 2x faster on the S23)

3- Storage speed: UFS 2.0 vs UFS 4.0 (around 4x more speed)

4- Chipset: Exynos 1380 vs SD 8 Gen 2 (500k vs 1200k Antutu score), the Exynos is an absolute mess when it comes to efficiency

5- Lack of optical image stabilization on the A54, and smaller camera lenses

6- Much better camera quality on the S23 (Watch the video I linked)

7- No wireless / Rev wireless charging on the A54

8- Plastic vs Metal frame

It says something like:

The package vendor.qti.data.txpwradmin is part of Qualcomm's proprietary Android middleware, and it is responsible for managing the transmit power of LTE and Wi-Fi radios on Qualcomm-based devices. 

This includes functions such as:

* Optimizing transmit power levels to improve battery life and network performance


* Adapting transmit power based on environmental factors and network conditions


* Enforcing regulatory compliance requirements for transmit power


The StxPwrService component within this package provides a service interface for other applications to query and control transmit power settings. This allows Qualcomm's proprietary software stacks, such as the modem firmware and Qualcomm's own cellular network stack, to manage transmit power in a way that is optimized for both performance and efficiency.

If you encounter errors or issues related to the vendor.qti.data.txpwradmin package, it is recommended to contact Qualcomm support or consult the documentation for your specific device.",3,0,1,GalaxyS23,18cv53y,1,7,2023-12-07 18:38:44,Top

2. Streaming - If App opened ""Anything with video"" Then Motion smoothness ""Adaptive"" +   
Dolby Atmos ""On:Movie"".
3. Charging Sleep - If Charging status ""Wired charging"" Specific time ""9:00pm Every day"" Then Protect battery ""On"" + Fast charging ""Off"".
4. Charging Awake - If Charging status ""Wired charging"" Specific time ""6:30am Weekdays"" Then Protect battery ""Off"" + Fast charging ""On"".
5. Disable ""Always On Display"".
6. Enable ""Dark mode"".
7. Leave Home - If Place ""Leaving: My address"" Then Mobile data ""On"" + Bluetooth ""On"" + Wi-Fi ""Off"" + Brightness ""40"" + Motion smoothness ""Standard"" + Sound mode and volume Sound/40/40/40 + Media volume 40/40/40.
8. Arrive Home - If Place ""Arriving: My address"" Then Mobile data ""Off"" + Bluetooth ""Off"" + Wi-Fi ""On"" + Brightness ""40"" + Motion smoothness ""Standard"" + Sound mode and volume Sound/40/40/40 + Media volume 40/40/40.

Keep in mind Motion smoothness being set to standard = 60HZ, I only care about video streaming apps. I don't care when I'm browsing if it means I'll conserve more battery.

I disabled Always On Display because I've never used it and I'll conserve more battery.

The last Media volume is Bluetooth, set that to whatever you want but in my case I'll probably move it to 100 because my phone automatically pairs with my car and I control the volume from the stereo not the phone.

No

>The gestures to switch to the previous app is not reliable compared to iOS gestures (swiping sligltly up and to the side), do I have to change something or am I performing the gesture wrong?

Had the same experience. I never liked the gestures anyways, switched to the OG Android buttons which allows me to a. switch apps by double tapping the task view button and b. switch to one handed view by double tapping the home button. You lose a bit of screen estate but it doesn't bother me. YMMV.

>Tapping on the clock to go to the top of the screen, is there a samsung version of this?

As far as I know there is no native way BUT there are hundreds of apps on the play store that can do this. I can't seem to recall some names though because I don't use it.

>I can't mute the mic during an outgoing call before the person picks up? 

I'm afraid this is not possible on OneUI. Not entirely sure about this but as far as I know it's not possible.

569,Is the banana gate still on S23?,jqiopkq,catalinus,"Bananagate is a very specific issue and not all S23 units have it, in fact possibly less than 10% of them have it.

True ""bananagate"" is when you take a picture of a flat object (like a newspaper) at a decent distance (at least 0.5m) and while you have the phone steady and perfectly parallel to the subject the resulting picture has one or more zones (possibly with a weird shape like a banana) that are out of focus while most of the picture is sharp.

This is different than depth-of-field focus results (which too often are reported as ""bananagate"" by people that do not understand depth-of-field), also different than minimal focus distance issues (which again people misreport often).

I did get last week a base S23/256 in EU for a member of the family and it did not have any ""bananagate"" problems, but when you are not very careful with your composition and you expect too much (and also you do not activate ""Prioritize focus over speed"" in Camera Assistant) you get pictures where you get to see depth-of-field focus issues. Also in the corners the lens is rather very soft - but so are most phone lenses without a variable aperture.",9,0,3,GalaxyS23,14pkdqn,7,31,2023-07-03 15:55:33,Top

Edit : it also has a bass tuner, here's the description:

Bass tuner¶
Bass tuner allows you to set a very precise bass boost or reduction. This can be useful if your speaker system has a resonant peak in the lower frequencies or a point where long soundwaves cancel each other out.

Bass type Allows you to choose between natural, transient compressor and sustain compressor types. The transient compressor adds the possibility to increase or decrease the initial bass punch. The sustain compressor preserves the transient and is able to increase or reduce the rumble. This can be used to reduce resonance without compromising the initial kick or to make balanced armature drivers sound less anemic.

Cutoff frequency determines until what frequency the sound is processed.

Post-gain sets the gain to compensate for. This value can either be negative or positive.",3,0,2,GalaxyS23,14l7vm0,0,3,2023-06-28 13:44:28,Top

On my phone, using the system monitor widget, I never see the RAM use go above about 7GB.  Obviously, that isn't going to trigger any reloads and 12GB is overkill for me.  My son plays games on his phone, which use more RAM, but he never seems to have an issue either.  I think you are safe with 8GB in most situations.",12,0,2,GalaxyS23,184b8e7,10,27,2023-11-26 14:09:37,Top

1) was not thrilled with no SD, but 1tb matches what my S10 had with an SD. For the folders, I did pretty as you say. There is also a dcim folder where the pics and screenshots end up, I generally put pics from other cameras there.

636,"Transform the S23 into a ""pure Android""",jp2kyz0,r_slash_jarmedia,"ADB allows you to use debloaters to remove some of Samsung's apps. but realistically you can just disable a lot of them or hide them from your launcher and never use them again. apart from that, OneUI is one of the most stable versions of Android out right now and is king in security/software updates, even when compared to Google's Pixel skin. if you don't like the general feel of Samsung's software, go with something like a Pixel, OnePlus, or Nothing phone. the OnePlus 11 is great, though not very compact. Nothing phone may be a good fit for you, but it's not exactly small & a new one is coming soon. Pixel 7's Tensor G2 gets hot and has poor efficiency so that's not a good idea either tbh.",8,0,1,GalaxyS23,14fyavw,0,12,2023-06-22 09:15:17,Top
